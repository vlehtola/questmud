# questmud
Questmud is a MUD (multi user dungeon) written with LPC (C variant). These sources are restored from a 2012 backup.

The game was mainly developed during 1996-2000 with smaller additions afterwards. During its golden age, Questmud had up to 35 players simultanously online and over a thousand individual registered players.

Multiple persons got their spark and first experiences in programming through Questmud. At this stage, this is more of a relic stored for following generations. Feel free to use, host, play, explore, edit, develop (within MIT license).
