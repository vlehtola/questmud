The gray hallway lays a dull atmosphere inside it. Hallway's concave-
shaped ceiling is in the height of ten feet. The hallway is completely
gray, except the red carpet on the floor and some stained red curtains
here and there on the walls. Few torches, which have been attached to
their holders on the walls, are luminating some light along the corridor.
The spacious hallway leads to west and east.


carpet ::
A red and cheap-looking carpet has been laid on the ground. It seems
to cover all the area along the hallway where the visitors and owners
of the castle are supposed to walk in. Some stained footprints can be
seen printed on the carpet.

curtains ::
Numerous stains and rags cover the red curtains hanging on the walls
in the hallway. The curtains are hanging from brass railings, which
are located near the ceiling. The curtains seem to be hanging on the
walls just for decoration and to cover some ugly fillings on the gray
stone wall.
