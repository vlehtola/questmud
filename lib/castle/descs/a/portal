Every corner of this small-sized castle room is filled with bright blossom
of yellow light and loud humming. The source of the light and humming seems
to be a man-sized, pulsating portal in the northern end of the room. Two
smooth pillars are framing the portal in its both sides. Some dry leaves can
be seen on the ground. The room, sunk in the yellow light, feels in the
same time relaxing and annoying.
A shining plaque is hanging on the wall.


portal ::
A bright yellow portal is located in an alcove in the northern wall. The
portal is humming with a loud sound, indicating that it is currently
fully operational. Through the portal one can be teleported in great
amount of different places, but its function is crucial to know before
stepping through it.

pillars ::
Two vertical pillars are framing the portal in north. They seem to be
in their places just for decoration and to direct even the most un-
intelligent beings to the actual portal. Due to the yellow light, the
colour of the pillars cannot be recognized, but it is quite certain
they are made of some valuable material.

leaves ::
Very exceptional sight inside the castle rooms: numerous fallen and
already dry leaves are lying on the ground. They must have travelled
through the portal into the castle. The leaves let a crackling sound
as they are crushed against the stony floor.
