chestroom
The crude stone walls lay a dull atmosphere over the rectangular room. The room is not big, but 
it has been stuffed full of various stuff. A small closet is located by the eastern wall. By the 
other end of the wall is standing a small bed, and in the end of the bed is lying a 
sturdy-looking iron chest. A tall candlestick is giving light to the room along with the window 
carved into the wall. A doorway is leading out to the hallway.
