courtyard
The fresh courtyard symbolizes the nature inside the castle walls. Main colour is absolutely 
green, which can also be seen colouring the plains and forests of Deleria. A path made of flat, 
ground stones meanders past the bushes and trees. Some birds can be heard singing on the branches 
of a nearby tree, but rest of the wildlife seems to stay outside the sturdy castle walls. The 
fresh air feels fabulous in your lungs after the musty air inside the castle.
