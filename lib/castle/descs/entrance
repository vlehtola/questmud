The large entrance hall is at least thirty feet high. A wooden chandelier is hanging high up in 
the ceiling. The castle walls have been made of rough, gray stones. On the floor is lying a thin, 
red carpet. Carpet continues from here further through the hallways of the castle. Guards' weapon 
cabinets are located in an alcove in the eastern wall. Two giant, open doors are located in the 
doorway leading out.
