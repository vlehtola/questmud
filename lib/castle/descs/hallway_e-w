hallway
The gray hallway lays a dull atmosphere inside it. Hallway's concave-shaped ceiling is in the 
height of ten feet. The hallway is completely gray, except the red carpet on the floor and some 
stained red curtains here and there on the walls. Few torches, which have been attached to their 
holders on the walls, are luminating some light along the corridor. The spacious hallway leads to 
west and east.
