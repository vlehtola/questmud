healing room
A small-sized, circular room is sparkling with red particles, rising from the floor and floating 
up into the ceiling. Under the floor there must be something special. The room is low, only about 
nine feet high. The walls, ground and ceiling are made of rough, round stones, their colour 
cannot be deciphered due to the red lighting of the room. No decoration is seen in the room, but 
the red mist and warm atmosphere give the room its respective being. A wooden sign is located 
near the doorway leading out of this room.
