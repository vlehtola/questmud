courtyard:

[spesiaalilookkiobjuja..                          ]

[A smooth, stony fountain is located next to the path.]
fountain ::
A sound made by running water brings the courtyard even more close to
some natural place. A crystal-clear water flows into a bowl carved into
the fountain from a small hole in the tip of a smooth stony pillar.
Thirsty adventurers may satisfy their thirst by drinking from this
beautiful fountain.

[A carved silver plaque is standing on a stony pedestal.]

entrance:
[item]
chandelier
A chandelier has been attached in the ceiling. It seems thoroughly been
made of wood, some joints have been reinforced with iron. There can
faintly be seen few places for candles in the chandelier, but it seems
that it has not been used in a long time. The chandelier must weight
a lot.
[item]
walls
A rough, gray stones and rocks form the sturdy walls of this castle. The
stones have not been ground nor cut after placing them in their current
places, making the walls look bumpy and somewhat uncomfortable to lean to.
[item]
carpet
A red and cheap-looking carpet has been laid on the ground. It seems to
cover all the area on the ground where the visitors and owners of the
castle are supposed to walk in. Some stained footprints can be seen
printed on the carpet.
[item]
cabinets
The wooden cabinets in the entrance room are used by the castle guards
to store their weapons and armour when not being on duty. Though the
cabinets are made of wood, with some steel reinforcements, they are
really sturdy-looking. Every of the cabinets contain an appropriate
lock for their containments.

curtains
Numerous stains and rags cover the red curtains hanging on the walls
in the hallway. The curtains are hanging from brass railings, which 
are located near the ceiling. The curtains seem to be hanging on the 
walls just for decoration and to cover some ugly fillings on the gray
stone wall.

sign
"Healing room, the room of regeneration and rebirth."

particles
About the size of a snowflake, these particles rise from the stony floor
of the healing room and rise all the way to the ceiling and even through
it. The particles seem to emit a bright red light and some warmth around
them. The particles are the only decoration this room has to offer.

portal
portal ::
A bright yellow portal is located in an alcove in the northern wall. The
portal is humming with a loud sound, indicating that it is currently
fully operational. Through the portal one can be teleported in great
amount of different places, but its function is crucial to know before
stepping through it.

pillars ::
Two vertical pillars are framing the portal in north. They seem to be
in their places just for decoration and to direct even the most un-
intelligent beings to the actual portal. Due to the yellow light, the
colour of the pillars cannot be recognized, but it is quite certain
they are made of some valuable material.

leaves ::
Very exceptional sight inside the castle rooms: numerous fallen and
already dry leaves are lying on the ground. They must have travelled
through the portal into the castle. The leaves let a crackling sound
as they are crushed against the stony floor.

plaque ::
[portal-commandit jotenki järkevästi (hienosti).]

[item]
window
A small window has been carved in the stony castle wall. Window's shape
is hardly recognizeable. Probably, it has been designed to be circular-
shaped. The light entering the room via window is brightened by the
torches, which are attached to the walls.
[item]
chandelier
A basic-looking wooden chandelier is hanging from the ceiling. The
chandelier seems to be few iron reinforcements on it, but mostly it
is made of wooden material. Despite all of its candle places, no
candles have been attached to the chandelier.

carpet
A red and cheap-looking carpet has been laid on the ground. It seems
to cover all the area along the hallway where the visitors and owners
of the castle are supposed to walk in. Some stained footprints can be
seen printed on the carpet. The carpet leads even down the stairs.
