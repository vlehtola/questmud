portalroom
Every corner of this small-sized castle room is filled with bright blossom of yellow light and 
loud humming. The source of the light and humming seems to be a man-sized, pulsating portal in 
the northern end of the room. Two smooth pillars are framing the portal in its both sides. Some 
dry leaves can be seen on the ground. The room, sunk in the yellow light, feels in the same time 
relaxing and annoying. A shining plaque is hanging on the wall.
