stairway up
The hallway ends in a narrow staircase leading up. The stones used in the stairs seem to be 
ground, unlike the other stones seen in ceiling, ground and walls. A small window is giving some 
light into this part of the castle through the wall. Some torches can also be seen attached on 
the walls and giving light in the staircase. A wooden chandelier is hanging down from the 
ceiling. The red carpet, which covers most of the hallways and rooms around the castle, continues 
up the stairs.
