QuestMud has news-system back online. Only wizards and admins are
allowed to post news. Admins will see if there will be need to give post access to mortals.
News groups are not meant to be discussion boards or forums and thus
there will have to be serious reasons to give post accesses to mortals.
Thanks to Gheldor for news-sys.
