As I have been creating it, I have got several thoughs, and I would
like to get some answers like idea(s), suggestion(s) or opinion(s)
about these ...

 - You aren't allowed to invite more members than there is clans
   available. [maximum_amount_of_members = amount_of_clans]
 
 - You are supposed to pay 100k*amount_of_clans when creating
   a new clan. This is just to disable the multi-usering cheat and
   to make you care more about your clan.
 
 - You are supposed to pay 50k for joining the clan. The same
   explanation as I said on the previous place. Also I forgot
   to mention, that the payment is done in bronze coins.
   
 - The list of ex-clans (The leader quit) is now functional,
   this also prevents the use of the same name later again.
   You can see the name of the clan, and the date when the
   leader typed 'clan leave' at the clanhall.
 - You need to be at level 80 to create a clan.
 
 - You need to be at level 50 to join a clan. Also you must
   accept that you might get killed severaly in a row. That's
   the "spirit" of being in the clan. ;)
 
 - There shall be _MAJOR DOWNTUNE_ for the equipment clan
   leader/member will possess, no more +30 all-stats for leader,
   or +15 all-stats boys... We will see what the Administration
   team will deciede about this... Yeah, I like you too =)
 
 - You are NOT supposed to just hunt and kill people... You'll
   only get one point per kill. If you play to kill, you are
   soon facing Arch+ to discuss about it. I bet you (Hunter)
   wouldn't like if someone would hunt you and wouldn't let you
   exp in peace...? Hope you guys see my point.
 
 - Arches and above are allowed to REMOVE or RESET those clans
   that can be proven as a cheater, if one of the members cheat,
   the whole clan will suffer. (Just like the army K(XD )
 
 - And as the last "informative" note I must say, that the Clans
   are mostly done, the coding side I mean. Now we need to think
   about it's future... /dev/null or /mud/ ? =)
   This means that you all who got ANY ideas about clans, please
   post em to me. (The mail-office is 1 east and 1 north from
   the Central Square)
   
 - Some of the terms are not negotiable, but you can still try.
   Such as preventing to cheat is almost impossible to get changed.
   Please keep in you mind, that we are creating this for you,
   and just for you. But we want your game-"lust" to keep on, which
   means balanced things and no cheating for your own good.
   (Or for your friends good! ;)

Ps. You can reply to this group for a while, before it'll be removed.
             
  Ps2. Don't bother mailiing me 'You suck' or 'Your tune is from ****!',
       I know all this by myself... =P

mjoo mun mielesta noitten klaanien tulis olla samanhintasia kaikille, koska jos kerran maksimijasenmaara == klaanien maara niita tarttis perustaa enemmankin ku vaan pari
jaja jos klaanin perustaminen maksaa sen 100k*klaanien maara pelaajilla ei oo varaa perustaa ku yhteensa ehka 2-3 klaania, joist tulis _melkosen_ pienia
enka usko et tan koko klaanihardellin tarkotus o tuottaa muutamaa 1-2 hengen klaania
joku 100k klaanin perustamisesta ja 50k siihen joinimisesta on kyl ihan hyva hinta sillee
mutmut, kannatan kyl noit klaanei peliin! 
tuovat lisaa eloa taha mudii
rakkaudella veron
