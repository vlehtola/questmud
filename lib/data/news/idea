Casting drain life at a heal resistant mob doesn't seem to work: Mob resists
healing. Imho drain life should work, because the caster is actually healing
him/herself and the mob gets drained or harmed or something. Well anyway,
fixing this would make it possible for a cleric to kill something bigger
than 500k (and it might even be possible to keep the quest info a secret as
the clerics wouldn't need a tank to make some of them ;).
