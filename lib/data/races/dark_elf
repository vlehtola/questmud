Dark elf
The dark elves once were a group of high elves practicing a secret
religion worshipping darkness. They were exiled from the elven lands and
found new home in huge tunnel complexes deep underground, in the darkness
they so loved. During the centuries they have founded cities and
multiplied. After living their life in the dark without seeing the
sun, their skin is white and sunlight hurts them. Nowdays, however, some
of them venture to the surface in seek of adventure and wealth.
