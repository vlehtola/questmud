Demon
Demons are unholy creatures from the depths of Hell.
They are extremely strong and fearsome warriors.
Some say that demons found a way to the world of
Deleria when some dark Heretics battled their way
to the Fountain of Life and sacrificed their own
lifes for their infernal masters who consumed
their bodies and started ravaging this once
beautiful world...
