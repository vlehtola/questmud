Dwarf
Dwarves are a tough and small race. They are numerous in the northern part
of the central island, living in their mines. Dwarves are famous in
Duranghom for their well crafted tools and weapons. For dwarves, length of
beard measures wisdom and respect, so many of them never shave their
beard.
