Giant
Giants measure about two times a man, and their strength is extraordinary.
They live in the eastern rocky forest islands in small tribes. They eat
anything they can kill with their simple weapons, from bears to smaller
animals. Seafarers of all races know to avoid their islands. Some giants
have however been seen even in Duranghom. Some people suspect they crossed
the seas swimming or as slaves in boats.
