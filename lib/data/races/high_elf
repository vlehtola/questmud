High elf
High elves are one of the oldest races in Deleria. They live in beautiful
cities that cover entire small islands in the far western seas, but some
of them have travelled even to Duranghom in search for enlightment. They
rarely do anything with they hands, preferring to use spells.
Their perfect looks and high intelligence are unmatched.
