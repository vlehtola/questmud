Lizardman
Lizardmans are big humanoid lizards. They are believed to inhabit the  
vaste southeastern swamps of the main island. Their culture is
mostly primitive, based on small tribes living on fishing. Due to
their long age, they are known to have some wise and powerful shamans
among them. Some promising young lizardmen have even ventured to Duranghom
in search for adventure.
