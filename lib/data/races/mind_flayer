Mind flayer
Mind flayers are creatures of the dark, a race born in the deepest
tunnels of this world. Instead of teeth, they have long tentacles in their
mouth to catch and chew their food. They live in a high society in which
each one has a task suited for his talents to perform for the greater
good of the society. They have made extensive use of magic and have
naturally good intelligence and mana regeneration. They are neighbors to
the dark elves, with whom they have fought several wars for the control of
underground tunnels.
