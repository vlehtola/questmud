Spirit
Spirits exists all around the world of Deleria.
Every living being has it's own spirit. A rumour
tells that some adventurers traveled to the
magical Fountain of Life to tap into their inner
strengths. Unfortunately the spirits within
were too powerful and wild to be enslaved and the
spirits destroyed their former bodies. Some of
those spirits still roam free in our beloved world.
