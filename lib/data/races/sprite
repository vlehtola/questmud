Sprite
Sprites are small, winged creatures who are closely connected with nature. 
They are often very beautiful and delicate. They are widely known of their
kindness and many legends tell about them helping lost people to find their
way home and about them preserving various rare plants, herbs and animals. 
Sprites make good spellcasters, and they are hard to hit because of their
tiny size and dexterousness. Due to their magical nature they live a long
life, which makes them slow learners.
