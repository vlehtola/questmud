Troll
Trolls are large hairy creatures with long, strong limbs. Their clumsy
appearance is only an illusion as a troll is able to move incredibly fast.
Their strength, constitution and rate of regeneration are remarkable
indeed. On the down side, trolls have a hard time learning skills well.
They live in villages in the forests east of Duranghom and are not very
concerned about the other races, as long as they stay away from their
lands.
