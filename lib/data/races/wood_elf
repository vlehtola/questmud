Wood elf
Wood elves are cousins of high elves. Unlike their relatives they have
chosen to stay and live in the heart of nature, the woods. They have built
scattered small treehouse villages in the large woods west of Duranghom.
They have grown weary of humans after the Duranghomian invasion that
eventually failed, although trade between some merchants from Duranghom
and the major wood elf towns is not uncommon. Their finely crafted wooden
goods are wanted and easily sold in any of the human cities.
