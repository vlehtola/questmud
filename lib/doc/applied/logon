SYNOPSIS
        int logon (void)
        int logon (int flag)

DESCRIPTION
        When the driver created a new connection (either by accepting
        it or by creating it with net_connect()) and bound it to an
        object, it then calls logon() in that object.

        The method should return 0 on failure, and everything else on
        success.

        If the driver attempted to create a connection in the
        background and failed, it will call logon(-1) in the intended
        object to inform the mudlib about the failure.

HISTORY
        LDMud 3.2.10 added the extended meaning for net_connect().

        connect(M), net_connect(E), exec(E)
