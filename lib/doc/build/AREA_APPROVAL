Some basic rules about area approval. The event takes place when
the creator of the area and the supervising archwizard both agree
the area is ready. This means 100% ready.

1. Supervisor must confirm that all stupid things and like are
   removed before the approval. See RULES and AREA_INSTRUCTIONS.

2. The area must be "in tune". This means it cannot contain too
   easy exp / eq. Unkillable monsters are permitted.

3. All features that affect permanently on players' eq, skills,
   total worth etc.. are illegal!
   Contact me if you want to make something like this.

4. The creator has the right to do any kind of area or feature as
   long it doesn't break the other rules.
   NOTE: The area must fit into Deleria's realm!

5. Exeption to rule 4. Any this_player()->hit_with_spell(...) specials
   for monsters are NO good! Use monsters' ability to melee, use skills,
   cast spells etc instead. If you want to make a room with deathtrap
   or a room built-in special that calls hit_with_spell it is allowed.
   NOTE: ALL hit_with_spell() specials on monsters and weapons are ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN!

6. After the approval the supervisor sends the report to an arch or elder by
   mudmail. The levels given come as the report states.
   The report must contain:
   - general idea and theme of area
   - quests (filenames, questnames and QP awards)
   - entrance to the area (file)
   - location on the outmap (coordinates based on world/race help files)
   - the amount of levels the creator will be given
