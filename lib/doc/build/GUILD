    GUILD BUILDING  18.10.2001 //Celtron

This doc is for wizards who are intrested in building skills/spells or (sub)guilds.

GENERAL RULES

1a. No two skills or guilds are the same. This means that they don't do the same thing.
    eg. "by taking guild A there is no need for guild B"- situations are not tolerated.

1b. Two players from different main guilds are not supposed to be capable of handling
    each others jobs. This does not include players that have taken two guilds and so
    are able to perform all things gained from those two guilds.
    eg. "by giving fighters the ability of archery, they can blast from bank rank and
         thus render mages obsolete."

2a. All guilds are not equal.
    eg. "whine about how easy it is to make exp as a low level cleric in party is ignored."

2b. All guilds do not posses the same amount of levels, subguilds or skills.
    eg. "clerics do not have many masteries and have low guild total level if compared to
         mages or fighters."

3.  No guild should have real-life bindings on them. This applies only to the name of the
    guild and skills. A rl faction/guild can be mirrored, but names should be changed.
    eg. "ninjas or samurais should be called martial artists or monks."
        "katana, bokken, shuriken are all terms not to be used."

4.  Try job room if there is something that matches your interests.
    Meaning there is something you want to do.

5.  If you do not want to make a guild that is listed in job room list, approve the idea
    of your guild (make an detailed plan on a file). Direct all these inqueries to Celtron.
    If your idea doesn't get approval, don't even bother start coding it.

6.  After approval: stick to the plan.

7.  Final point: If your idea does not pass these rules, do not bother arguing about it.
