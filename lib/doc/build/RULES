These are the rules for a wizard.

1. You may not help other players, even if they lost points due to
   lost connection. They have to go to the post office and ask the gods,
   or use 'bug'.

2. Never attack a player or kill him. If a player behaves badly, file
   the complaint to the gods.

3. Do not make 'deadly' traps. A player must never die because he didn't
   know what happens in the next room. If some room is very dangerous,
   make some hint.

4. Never initialize the destination of an object outside your area. If you
   make a monster that can walk out of the area, be sure that it is a
   very nice monster.

5. Never generate messages that looks like something it isn't (good and precise
   rule :-). That is, don't try to fool the player that someone says something
   when it isn't true etc.

6. If you have a "test" character, make sure is isn't seen in the top score
   list. He must not be a wizard either. Use 'tester make [name]' to make him
   a test character so he wont be marked in the plaque.

7. Try to avoid making devices, situations which makes the players lose
   experience if they are adventuring or examining objects. Players should be
   rewarded for adventuring and discovering things. If they get killed...
   Well, they will then loose some experience, but this is a special case!

8. The game is supposed to be in the "long distant past", and thus no
   modern things should exist. If you want some kind of airplane, use a
   flying horse in stead etc.

9. Read other documentation on how to build rooms and monsters. Use the
   examples in /doc/examples. You should try to learn from them to make
   your own things, not just copy them and change the messages.

10. Hug Nalle (even tho he didn't make this file) ;)
