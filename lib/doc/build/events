        The Eventsystem of QuestMUD
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Basics
 ~~~~~~
First of all, there is no easy way to create an
event. The system is only designed to make it
easier to run events and add new ones. All
events are unique and you must know how to code
on your own to create an event. You can't just
C&P existing events, that would only create boring
event-duplicates.

But don't be put of by this file. It's actually
fun to create events, because you can really
use your imagination. Also remember that if you
have a really good idea for an event but you
don't know how to code it, then contact your
fellow wizards. They might be able to help you.

 System
 ~~~~~~
All events must have a "master file". That file
contains the functions needed to start and stop
the event, along with some other functions.
Basicly, the master file is the only required
thing for an event but most events have other
files too. Some events even have special areas
where the events take place.

The type of the return value is at the end of
the functions description in ()'s.
The master file should contain the following functions:

query_name()
 Return the name of the event. (string)

query_creator()
 Return the name of the event's creator. (string)

query_event_desc()
 Return the description of the event. This should
 contain info for wizards. (string)

query_mortal_desc()
 Return the description of the event for mortals.
 (string)

query_limit()
 The level of wizardhood needed to run the event.
 All wizards can run their own events despite the
 limit. (int)
 (1 = Apprentice wizard, 2 = Wizard, 3 = Arch,
 4 = Higher arch, 5 = Elder)

query_active()
 Return "Yes" if the event is active and "No" if
 it isn't. (string)

run_event()
 This function is called when the event is run.

end_event()
 This function is called when the event is over
 or when a wizard wants to stop the event.

When you think that your event is ready and tested
contact Rag.

 Examples
 ~~~~~~~~
An example event is located in /doc/examples/event/
It is the 'Treasure hunt' event written by Rag.
It contains the following files:

start.c   - The master file
master.c  - A NPC that handles the event
map.c     - The treasure map
minimap.c - A rip-off from the actual outworld files,
            this file is used to create the long_desc
            of the treasure map.
