Each time a player find out something special you should call 'set_quest()'

Example:
	this_player()->set_quest("my_special_quest", 1);

  To set 'my_special_quest' done and reward it for 1 quest point.

If you use this on a quest that has all ready been rewarded, it will have
no effect.


Use query_quests() with questname as an argument to see if a player has
completed a quest. The call returns 1 if the quest is complete otherwise 0.

Example:
	this_player()->query_quests("my_special_quest", 1);


Examples for quest point distribution:

1-2 quest points even for the simplest thing: figuring out a special
command. Could be just something seen in the long desc. To encourage
reading long descs.

3-8 quest points for something a bit more complex, perhaps when
completing a serie of special commands in different places.

4-10 quest points for giving some monster something it wants, that
you have to get elsewhere. If this includes just killing some monster
the qp award must be lower than if the quest can be done some other way.

NO MORE THAN 8 QPs ARE AWARDED FOR KILLING QUESTS! (no matter how big monster)
