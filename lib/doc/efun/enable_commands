SYNOPSIS
        void enable_commands()

DESCRIPTION
        Enable this object to use commands normally accessible to
        users. This also marks the current object as "living".

        Avoid to call this function from other places then from inside
        create() (or reset(0) in compat mode), because the command
        giver will be set to this object.

EXAMPLE
        void create() {
           enable_commands();
       ...
        }

        This will make the current object a living object.
