SYNOPSIS
        mixed get_type_info(mixed arg, int flag)

DESCRIPTION
        Returns info about the type of arg, as controlled by the flag.

        If the optional argument <flag> is not a number, an array is
        returned, whose first element is an integer denoting the data
        type, as defined in <lpctypes.h>. The second entry can contain
        additional information about arg.

        If <flag> flag is the number 0, only the first element of that array
        (i.e. the data type) is returned (as int). If <flag> is 1, the
        second element is returned.

        If <arg> is a closure, the <flag> setting 2 lets the efun
        return the object of the closure (which for 'alien lfun closures' is
        the object the lfun is defined in, not the object the closure is
        bound to).

        For every other <flag> setting, -1 is returned.

        The secondary information is:
          - for mappings the width, ie the number of data items per key.
          - for symbols and quoted arrays the number of quotes.
          - for closures, the (internal) closure type, as defined in
            <lpctypes.h>.
          - for strings 0 for shared strings, and non-0 for others.
          - -1 for all other datatypes.

BUGS
        This function seems to be due to frequent changes as the
        driver develops resp. is debugged.

HISTORY
        Introduced in 3.2@127
        Flag setting 2 was introduced in 3.2.1@84.
        Secondary string information was introduced in 3.2.7.
        Up to 3.2.7 inclusive, get_type_info(closure,2) did not return
          the object from a lambda closure or bound-lambda closure.
        Up to 3.2.9 inclusive, get_type_info(closure,2) did not return
          the object from a efun, simul-efun or operator closure.
