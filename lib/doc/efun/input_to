SYNOPSIS
        #include <sys/input_to.h>

        void input_to(string|closure fun)
        void input_to(string|closure fun, int flag, ...)
        void input_to(string|closure fun, int flag, string|closure prompt, ...)

DESCRIPTION
        Enable next line of user input to be sent to the function <fun>
        as an argument. Exception: if the next input
        line starts with a "!", it will be parsed as a command resp.
        passed to the most recent input_to() given with the
        INPUT_IGNORE_BANG flag.
        The function <fun> may be static, but must not be private (or
        it won't be found).

        Note that fun is not called immediately but after pressing the
        RETURN key.

        If input_to() is called more than once in the same execution,
        only the first call has any effect. On the other hand, if
        a command given during an input_to() (using the "!" escape)
        issues its own input_to(), the previous input_to() is suspended
        until the new input_to() has been handled, then the previous
        one becomes active again.

        The optional argument <flag> may be a binary-OR ('|') of the
        following option values:

          INPUT_NOECHO  (1):
              The line given by the player will not be echoed, and is
              not seen if snooped.

          INPUT_CHARMODE  (2):
              The connection is switched from line- into charmode to
              retrieve a single character(!) from the player.

              After execution of <fun>, the connection is switched
              back into linemode unless a subsequent input_to( , 2)
              has been issued.

              Lineends are received depending on how the client sends
              them: either as "", as "\r" followed by "", or (happens
              with Windows clients) as just "\r".

              Note that the players frontend is free to stay in
              linemode all the time: even if you request a single
              character, the player might be forced to type (and send)
              that character plus the return key. Usually your function
              will then receive the complete input in one call.

              If you plan to stay in charmode a longer time , you can
              reduce the call overhead by using set_combine_charset()
              to retrieve sequences of certain characters as one string
              instead of one-by-one. In a screen-oriented editor for
              example this would be most of the printable characters.

          INPUT_PROMPT (4):
              The argument following the <flag> argument is used as
              prompt for the input. If this flag is not given, and thus
              no prompt specified, nothing will be printed.

          INPUT_IGNORE_BANG  (128):
              Input lines starting with '!' will _not_ be parsed as
              commands, but are given to the function as well. Usage
              of this option is privileged.

        The optional trailing args will be passed as second and
        subsequent args to the function fun.

EXAMPLE
        void func() {
           ...
           input_to("enter_name", INPUT_PROMPT, "Please enter your name:");
           /* The traditional way of doing this was:
            *   write("Please enter your name:");
            *   input_to("enter_name");
            */
           ...
        }
        enter_name(string str) {
           write("Is '"+str+"' really your name?? *giggle*\n");
           ...
        }

        When reaching the input_to() statement the driver
        continues the function func() but also asks the user for
        input. If you entered whatever is asked and press RETURN the
        driver will invoke the enter_name() function with the
        string you entered as argument to it.

HISTORY
        The meaning of the flag parameter was extended in 3.2.1@93.
        The limited "stacking" of input_to()s issued from !-commands
        was implemented in LDMud 3.2.8.
        Since LDMud 3.2.8 the function can be given as a closure.
        LDMud 3.2.9 introduced the INPUT_PROMPT flag and argument.

BUGS
        In CHARMODE, newlines should really be returned as "\n"; however,
        this might break existing code.
