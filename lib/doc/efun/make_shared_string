SYNOPSIS
        string make_shared_string (string str)

DESCRIPTION
        Puts <str> in _the_ list of shared strings of the game.

        If the string is used by several variables/objects this
        saves memory. Keys of alists and mappings are always shared
        strings.

BUGS
        A better string handling in the driver should make this
        efun unnecessary.

HISTORY
        Introduced in LDMud 3.2.6; following a suggestion from TubMud.
