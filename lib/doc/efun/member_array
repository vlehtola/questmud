DEPRECATED
SYNOPSIS
        int member_array(mixed item, mixed *arr)
        int member_array(mixed item, string arr)

DESCRIPTION
        Returns the index of the first occurence of item in array arr,
        or occurence of a character in a string. If not found, then -1
        is returned.

        If you want to search through an alist, use assoc() because
        member_array() is good for unsorted but assoc() is faster for
        sorted arrays.

HISTORY
        Superseeded by member().
        Since LDMud 3.2.9, not available if driver is compiled without
          USE_DEPRECATED.
