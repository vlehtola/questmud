SYNOPSIS
        int net_connect(string host, int port)

DESCRIPTION
        Open a non-blocking TCP network connection to <host> and
        <port>.  On success, the connection is bound to the current
        object and the lfun logon() is called in the object.

        Return 0 on success, and a Unix ERRNO on failure.

        If the driver is configured to support IPv6, <host> is first
        interpreted as IPv6 hostname. If that fails, <host> is then
        interpretd as IPv4 hostname.

        If the connection can't be established immediately, the efun
        returns 'success' and the driver will check in the background
        for the progress of the connection. When it is established,
        logon() will be called in the object. If the connection fails,
        logon(-1) will be called in the object.

        The efun raises a privilege violation ("net_connect", host, port).

        WARNING: If <host> is a name and not an IP, the driver
        performs a DNS lookup which may block for some time.
