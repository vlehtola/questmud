SYNOPSIS
        int send_udp(string host, int port, string message)
        int send_udp(string host, int port, int * message)

DESCRIPTION
        Sends The message in an UDP packet to the given host and port
        number.

        The efun causes a privilege violation. If USE_DEPRECATED is in effect,
        it first tries privilege violation ("send_imp"), and, if this one
        returns 0, then it tries privilege violation ("send_udp").
        If USE_DEPRECATED is not in effect, it just tries privilege
        violation ("send_udp").

        Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.

        Note: On some machines a failed send_udp() will not be registered
        until the next send_udp() - the latter one might return '0' even
        if itself was successful.

HISTORY
        LDMud 3.2.9 renamed this efun from send_imp(), and also changed the
          privilege violation string and the apply names. This old version
          is available if the driver is compiled with USE_DEPRECATED.
