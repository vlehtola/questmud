SYNOPSIS
        int to_int(string)
        int to_int(float)
        int to_int(int)
        int to_int(closure)

        (int)<value>

DESCRIPTION
        Floats are truncated to integer values, strings with leadings
        digits are converted to integers up to the first non-digit.
        lfun-closures are converted into their function index,
        variable closure are converted into their variable index.
        Integers are just returned.

        Regarding floats, it is important to keep rounding effects
        in mind: to_int(3.1*10.0) does not return 31, but instead 30,
        because internally the result of the multiplication is 30.999999 .

BUGS
        The cast notation only works if the precise type of <value>
        is known at compile-time. This will not be fixed - use the
        function form instead.
