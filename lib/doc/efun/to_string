SYNOPSIS
        string to_string(mixed)

        (string)<value>

DESCRIPTION
        The argument is converted to a string. Works with int, float,
        object, arrays, symbols, strings, and closures.

        Converts closures into an appropriate name (this has mostly
        debugging purposes).

        CAVEAT: Arrays are considered exploded strings, ie. arrays of
        char codes, and are 'imploded' up to the first 0 or the first
        non-number entry, whatever comes first. That means that
        to_string( ({ 33, 34 }) ) will return "12" and not "({ 33, 34 })".

BUGS
        The cast notation only works if the precise type of <value>
        is known at compile-time. This will not be fixed - use the
        function form instead.

HISTORY
        LDMud 3.2.8 adds lambda closures to the accepted data types.
