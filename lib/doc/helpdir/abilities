Abilities in QuestMUD

Abilities give your character special powers which cannot
be acquired with skills or equipment.

The ability room in Duranghom shows you info about the
abilities. Some abilities give you more info about them
when you have them fully trained.

You can train abilities at the ability room. They start
to function when they are trained to 100%. You can clear
your ability training by typing 'exp clear ability'.

Abilities are cleared at reincarnation.
