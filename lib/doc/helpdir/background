    BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Character's background defines the first steps of his life. The background
is basically the first guild you choose or the first 15 to 20 levels of it. 
Advancing in this guild is done as normal.

However all new skills are raised immediately to the available level maximum.
This means that when a player advances, he gets right away the skills offered
at that level. Although there is a maximum skill level that background skills
do not excede (it is assumed that a player doesn't have outstanding knowledge
of anything during his youth). Skills left to this limit can be improved
with normal training.

The background stage eases and simplifies the first steps of new mortals,
as they do not get confused by free experience (and training).

Every new or reincarnating mortal will have to play through the background stage.
Consider this as a minor discouragement towards reincarnation.
