You can boost your offensive spells with additional spell points.

You set your boosting with the 'cast' command.
For example:
   cast offensive 45

will set you boosting your offensive spells with 45 spell points.


When casting offensive spells, with each spell point you use in
boosting, you inflict a certain amount of damage to the target. This 
amount is called damage/sp ratio. Some skills, like 'power channeling',
affect on how good this ratio is, to a certain limit, which is
defined by your skills knowledge.

For example, if you have 'power channeling' at 'very poor', you will have
a chance to boost your offensive spells with 50 spell points with a low
damage/sp ratio. Any sp boost that goes beyond that limit, will be used
with a very low ratio.

But if you had 'power focusing' at 'adequate' in addition, the first 100
sps in your offensive boosts would be used with an average ratio and the
50 sps with a low ratio and anything beyond that with very low ratio.

You will get information about your damage/sp ratio when setting the
boost.

Default boost for offensive spells is 40 sp.
