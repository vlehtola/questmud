  REPORTING BUGS

If something seems to be like it shouldn't, read the help files and think twice
before you start whining. Contact wizards by 'bug'-command or mudmail. 
This is the best way. Remember that wizards perform their duties only because
they like to do so, as you like playing mud. If you piss them off, nobody will
help you.

Describe the bug you encountered as well as possible, write down (on your report)
everything you know or suspect about it. When it does occur and what causes it.
This guarantees that the bug will be fixed more swiftly.

General whining, or notes that 'xxx bugs' are stricly ignored. You must be able
to replicate the bug if asked to. If you have a log about what happened,
include it to the mudmail. In case that you lost something valuable, unless you
can prove it, nothing will be given 'back'.

Direct mudmails to archwizards or their superiors.
