Channels are for communication.

Syntax: channels <verb> <channel> [ <msg> ]

verb: send / join / leave / who / create
channel: default channels are mud / fin / sales / inform (and wiz for wizards)
msg: your message, if you use "send" argument

Examples:
  channels send mud Hi all!
  channels join fin
  channels leave fin
  channels who mud
  channels create my_own_channel

Also:
  you have auto shortcuts like for example:
	wiz we rock!
  has the same effect than:
	channels send wiz we rock!

  if you want to see the current last messages of a channel, type:
	channels send <channel> last
  example:
	channels send mud last
  or
	mud last
