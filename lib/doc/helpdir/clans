Clans of QuestMud are made for players that want to kill each other.

It is LEGAL for a member or leader of a clan to slaughter any other
clan leaders/members that are in other clan. However clan leaders or
members do NOT have any right to kill players who are not in any
clan, nor their own clan members.

Getting clan-killed results in change of clan scores, losing 100k total
worth and -1 % modifier to all of your stats. The stat modifier resets
whenever a clan player reincarnates or leaves his clan. Clan scores can be
seen in the clan room. Clan-kill score is calculated by the following formula:

	score = level_of_killed^2 / level_of_killer^2;

Score cannot be negative and the minimum score is 1. Score is directly
added to the clan score and taken from the other clan's score.

The leading clan is calculated every time reboot occurs. The leader and
the members of leading clan get special equipment granted by the gods of chaos.
This equipment lasts until the next reboot.

Clans can be created and joined in the clan room situated in the
city of Duranghom. Creating and joining a clan costs money.
You need to be atleast level 50 to join and level 70 to create a clan.
