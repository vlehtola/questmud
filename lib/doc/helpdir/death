	DEATH

Dying is part of the game. It's not the end of world.
Several things happen when you die.
  - you turn into a ghost and are transferred into hell
  - you risk to lose experience gathered for next level
  - you risk to lose skilltrainings
  - you get a temporary weakness which reduces your hpmax
  - you get a scar on you body which weakens you

To prevent one or more of these things from happening
you have the following options:
  - be more careful next time
  - accept resurrection from khaland or some player
  - pray (lose all exp&trains)
  - get your scar removed by a cleric

There are two different resurrection spells. Caster's
skills affect the experience saved. Otherwise the spells
have the same effect on the target.

When dead, it is possible of being reincarnated into a
completely new character, but still allowed to keep all
the experience you have ever succesfully managed to gather
into levels and skills. This means you end up into character
creation phase and afterwards you can train and advance with
how much you happen to have experience (total worth).
