Displays your combat factors. The hit chance stands for your percentual chance
of not missing a melee hit with your right hand attack. This doesn't mean that
the opponent can't dodge, parry or otherwise avoid the hit.

If you are wielding two weapons, the hit chance will drop. Training the skill
'two weapons combat' negates the hit penalty. If your weapons are of the same
type, the hit percent stands also for your left hand attacks.

Parry and defence factors give some direction of your chances to avoid hits in
combat. Your dodge is affected by the weight of load you are carrying. Parry
sums your weapon and shield parrying capabilities.

Your tiredness affects your all three capabilities, the less endurance points
you do have (compared to the maximum endurance points) the more do the factors
drop. With maximum endurance you fight better than normally.
