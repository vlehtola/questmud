Command: email [<your email>]
Argument: A string, or nothing

It is advised that you submit your e-mail address with this 
command. It will prove useful should you misplace your password, 
as consequently you will retain a chance of recovering it.

Archs may also use the information you submit to contact you
if it is deemed necessary, and mudmail is unlikely to work. 

The addresses will not be divulged to mortals or any third parties.

Example: email foo.bar@hunaja.com
         email
