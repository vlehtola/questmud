Emotes are a way of expressing your feelings. They will show a message
to other players in the room. If the target of the emote is a player
but is not in your room, the emote will be sent to that player. 
Sent emotes have a @ in front of them, and some colors, where available.

You can get a list of valid emotes with the 'emotes' command,
and the list of adverbs with the 'adverbs' command. It is not always
necessary to type the whole adverb, at least the first three letters 
may suffice.

Note that some emotes require a target, and they might have predefined
targets, adverbs or bodyparts if you do not specify one. 

Examples :
        hug nalle
        spank nalle butt
        poke eye evilly nalle
        lick axe
