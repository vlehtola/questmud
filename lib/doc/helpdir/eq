EQ also known as equipment or 'equip'

The world of Deleria offers many kinds of equipment to an active adventurer.
However, all of these items cannot be worn. The character must be skilled
enough to know how to use these items sufficiently well.

In other words this means that there is a level limit for succesfully
wearing a piece of equipment. This is meant to be aswell a game balancing
aspect to prevent newly created characters from wearing full battle plate
armors.
