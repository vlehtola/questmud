Fill this document if you are absolutely sure that you want to become a wizard in Questmud.
You should fill all the empty slots with care, your wizzing depends on it.
Your first job is to learn to code and to get familiar with the system. You can ask help.

Your mortal character will be forever lost. Wizzing is not a reinc. You can't get your
exp / eq back after you have been wizzed. You are not a part of the game anymore.

You are expected to complete coding of an area of your own during the first month, idle
wizards are not needed. Area should contain more than 40 rooms, different monsters and
some quests. If you do something stupid, you will be punished. Ask higher wizards if
you are not sure about your acts legality.
