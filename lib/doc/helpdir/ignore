Command: ignore [<player / level>]

  If you use no argument, a message indicating whom you currently ignore
will be displayed. It will also indicate whether you have level ignore 
set.

Argument:
<player>
  Should you with to ignore a specific person use his or her name
as the argument for ignore. Use the same procedure to set the ignore
off, or subsequently back on. A friends list has no effect on
specific ignores set with the name of a player.
<level>
  You may also wish to ignore players of under a certain level. In this
case, just use a number as an argument. The number must be lower than
your current level. Use the number '0' to disable level ignore.
Note that if a person is on your friendslist, his or her messages shall 
be visible to you despite any level ignore. 
 
 Both types of ignore apply to messages sent using 'tell' and channels. 

Examples: ignore nalle
          ignore 21

See also 'tell' and 'friends'.
