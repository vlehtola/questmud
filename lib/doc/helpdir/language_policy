The proper language to use in every mortal accessible public
channel is English.

The only exceptions to this rule are the "swe", "fra" and "de" 
channels where you must speak the appropriate language and the 
"chat" channel where you may utilize any language you wish.

Due to the nature of the public education system in Finland, it is
assumed by the administration that finnish players possess at least
a moderate comprehension of the English language. Therefore, the
employment of the English language is permitted on the "fin" channel
as well.

Extended and/or intentional breaking of this rule, premeditated or
involuntary is condemned, and may be punished by the archwizards 
as they see fit.
