The proper language to use in every mortal accessible public
channel is english.

The only exceptions to this rule are the "fin", "swe", "fra" and "de" channels
where you must speak the appropriate language and the "chat" channel where
you can talk what ever language you want.

Extended and intentional breaking of this rule is punished by
the archwizards as they see fit.
