Players gain more levels by advancing in their guild.

Advancing levels results in gaining more physical power in forms
of possibility to train more skills, increased stats, increased
amount of hit, spell and endurance points plus their regain rate.
Other players and wizards respect more a player of higher level.

Also it results as small decrease in gained experience amounts
from killed monsters. NOTE: This penalty ceases to increase after
you reach the 80th level.

Mortal levels are NOT limited, but to the total sum of all guild levels
counted together. This ultimately means that you can be a all-knowing,
all-mighty champion of Deleria.

Levelcosts increase noticeably after 100th level. Avoiding this is
possible with the help of a wish. Also you will receive additional
+1% all stats for every level after the 100th.
