Command: look [at <object>]
Argument:

Without argument 'look' displays information about your surrounding;

that are present.

The look command has a shortcut: 'l'. For example:
  l             (same than 'look')

Look can also display the magical weaknesses of the target if you
have trained skills like 'cast fire'.
