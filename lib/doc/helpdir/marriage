Marriage is a a very simple ceremony in QuestMUD and there is not
too much glamour to it. Then again glamour is not what MUD marriages
are about, they're about fun. You can get married in a chapel somewhere
outside Duranghom.

Remember, don't take MUD marriages too seriously. Marriage-related 
pkills are _not_ acceptable. Report bugs to Nalle.
