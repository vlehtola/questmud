Masteries are something that are learned by repetition and routine.

Some of them are quite easy to learn but some take a long time to
increase. The more complex and powerful your skills and enemies
are, the easier it is to gain masteries. In case of offensive
masteries your target must be a monster if you wish to gain more
masteries. Also, you won't gain any masteries if your enemies
are too small.

You will lose a part of your masteries if you choose to
reincarnate.

You can see your masteries by typing 'masteries'. To get info
about a specific mastery, see 'help mastery <mastery name>'.
