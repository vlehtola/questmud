	Help MUD

MUD is an acronym for Multi User Dimension, meaning a text based internet
game where players can interact. MUDs are generally fantasy roleplaying
based, like QuestMud.

The goal of the game is to improve your character. Having read fantasy
literature or played roleplaying games helps a lot in understanding what
this is all about.

The main measure of the toughness of your character is your total
experience. You get it mainly from killing monsters. With experience you
can advance experience levels in various guilds, the fighters guild for
example, which allow you to train skills. The better are your skills,
tougher monsters you can kill and the more experience you get. Most guilds
have about 10 levels.
