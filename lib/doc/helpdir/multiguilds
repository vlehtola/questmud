MULTIGUILDS

When picking a guild, the chosen guild is not necessarily a base guild.
Choosing a base guild restricts the player from joining other guilds than
the sub guilds of the chosen base guild.

Choosing a multiguild allows a player to have two base guilds and the
chosen multiguild itself. Then he can join all the sub guilds of these
three guilds.

ADVANCING

When a multiguild is chosen, the player must first complete his background
as usual. After that he must complete the other base guild. Then he can
join the multiguild itself and after joining it, he can join any of the sub
guilds of the three guilds if there are no sub guild specific restrictions.

AVAILABLE MULTIGUILDS

The multiguilds that are currently in game and the secondary guilds related
to them as follows.

Multiguilds:        Secondary guilds:
  Paladin            Fighter and cleric
  Abjurer            Mage and cleric
  Battlemage         Mage and fighter
  Chaos knight       Fighter and necromancer


OBSERVE. A multiguild can only have 1 level, however choosing it still
permits you to have the 2 base guilds related to it and their subs.

NEW!! It is possible to advance against the multiguild restrictions,
      but it is not always recommanded. There is no ill effect for doing so.
