PARTYING

Players can form parties.

Being in a group (aka party) allows players to conquer bigger foes.
Partying is also good for getting experience.

The amount of experience you get from a monster while being in a party depends
of your level relative to the levels of other players in the party.
In the 'party status' screen, the rightmost column explains how much exp you
get when a monster is killed.

PLAYERS WITH TOO LOW LEVEL DO NOT LEARN NEW THINGS

If your character has a too low level, compared to the player with the
highest level in your party, you will not receive any experience from killed
monsters. This is because the level difference is so big that you most likely
aren't any use to the party, but just tagging along without learning anything.
This is the case, if the rightmost column of 'party status' says 'none'.

A player is considered of not learning anything, if his level multiplied by two
plus 20 is less than the highest level of the party. 
Example: Level 20 cleric can learn new things while partying with a level 55 warrior,
but not with a level 72 mage.

The restriction does not apply to players with level 60 or greater.

See 'party help' for more information.
