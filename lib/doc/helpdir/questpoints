	QuestPoints (TM)

You get Quest points from completing various tasks and quests.

You get a free level if you have enough Quest points. The amount you need
is your level divided by four (rounded down), plus one.

So for example if you are level 14 you would need 4 quest points to
advance to level 15 free.

Quest points reset to your current maximum at reincarnation.
