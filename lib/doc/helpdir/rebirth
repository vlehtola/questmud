REBIRTH in QuestMud

When a mortal reaches the limit of certain total worth, he can choose to
"reborn". The limit is 15G for the first rebirth and 30g for second. 3rd
rebirth is only available in very special circumstances. This results in
starting over with no totals, but with many special abilities. You also
lose your questpoints in rebirth.

If you seek to rebirth, you should look for the fountain of life.

The reason why these special abilities are not listed here, is to keep
a little secrecy about the matter. These features are listed for the
reborn characters with the "rebirthinfo" command.
