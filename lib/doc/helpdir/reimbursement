             **REIMBURSEMENT OF EQ's**
             *************************
             *************************

Please cherish your eq's like your life depends on it.
In some ways, it actually does. 

To owning a piece of equipment, worn by some of the
toughest foes in the game comes responsibility. This
means stowing your eq away in a locker whenever you're
not using them. 

If your eq is lost during a crash of the game, or due to
a bug you might get your eq back. If the items are lost
due to negligence, failure to tell the time of reboot,
idling with eq on etc. do not expect the sympathy of
wizards.

If you feel you have been mistreated, contact a wizard
of lvl 300+ and be very nice.
