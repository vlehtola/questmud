           Reincarnation in QuestMud

Reincarnation means a way to recreate your character - with the current
total experience you have. After reincarnation all the experience you
have ever gained can be spent again for advancing levels and skills.
Your questpoints and taskpoints will also come usable again.

This means that after playing two weeks as a fighter, you can get a
reincarnation for your character and create a mage with all the experience
you have made as a fighter. The experience available for trainings is
so-called 'free experience', which means that you don't need to pay money
for training.

You CANNOT lose any free experience by dying or by getting a new reincarnation.
However there can be a cost for a reincarnation, for example a 5% cost means
that you will lose 5% of your total experience in the reincarnation progress.

Reincarnation cost is a constant percentage value of your total worth, reduced
by 1% every day. Meaning that after some days the cost is zero.

Currently, reincarnations (free of experience cost) are offered in the cleric
guild by a friendly cleric, Khaland. However, he will take a small fee of his
services.

You will have to live through the background stage again, no free experience nor
quest points can be used to gain levels during your first guild.
