Usage: rep <string>

Puts a prefix to your typing.

so f.e. 'rep tell walla' will have 'tell walla'
in front of everything you type.

This feature is quite nifty if you want to paste
long messages to someone.

If I catch anyone abusing the afore mentioned
example, there will be hell to pay.


-walla
