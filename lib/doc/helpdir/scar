Info on: SCAR

When a player dies and is revived he may get a scar in the process.
The wound of the death blow that struck him is not entirely healed
as it leaves a mark on the body, the scar.

Scars have a negative effect on physical attributes. It is however
possible to get rid of them. If a player dies many times, several
scars can occur.
