            Skills in Questmud

Skills are the mortal knowledge and power. They represent what your
character can do, what he knows. The guilds teach different skills
that they valor, players can also teach skills for one to another.
Some skills are physically demanding acts and they need endurace
points when performed. 

You can get specific help for one skill by 'help skill <skillname>'.
To be able to see this, you need to have atleast some knowledge of
the skill or you must be in the guild that teaches that skill.

Skills can also be improved by using them in combat. They do not
improve easily but by playing on the skills do automatically get
better. Skill levels improved by this way are shown bold with
'skills' command.

'estimate <skillname>' displays the endurance needed for such act.

The 'skills' command displays your current skills.
See 'help teach' for teaching skills to other players.
See 'help use' for using non-automatic skills.
