SPAM

Pronunciation: 'spam
Function: noun
Etymology: from a skit on the British television series Monty Python's 
Flying Circus in which chanting of the word Spam (trademark for a 
canned meat product) overrides the other dialogue.
: unsolicited usually commercial e-mail sent to a large number of 
addresses.

Spam is something everyone dislikes. If a person starts spamming you
without your concent, try to solve it in the following ways:

1) ask the person to stop
2) if the player is at a lower level than you, ignore <player>
3) gag the player. works as follows
   a) for TF users:
      /gag *string*
      (where string is the player's name)
  
   b) for ZMUD users (v. 6.40+):
      #gag *string*
      (where string is the player's name)
4) Contact an archwizard and explain the problem to him.

Spamming is a punishable deed and will not be tolerated in the game.
The same goes for channel spamming. 

Punishments will be channelbans for channelspamming and/or zappings.
For spamming other players the punishment will include zaps.
Spamming to an archwizard will result in an immediate zap and/or ban.
