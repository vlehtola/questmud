The spellcasting in QuestMud is based on little words, or syllabes that
form the spell. For example 'earth bolt' is cast with the words:
	exs sol blt
and for the cleric spell 'drain health' the words are:
	chl xfr min
Format is:
	cast <word1> <word2> <word3> at <target>
Wrong spellwords or wrong order result in no effect ("nothing happens").

You have to have a skill for each word, 'cast earth' for 'sol' for example
and 'cast essence' for 'exs'. Fail check will be made upon every word you
pronounce. Skill % will also affect the result highly.

Stats increase spell chances and effects, intelligence affects essence
spells and wisdow divine ones.

If you have a spellbook and the spell you are casting described in it,
your chances in succeeding will be higher, but it will not affect the
effect.

To increase your spellcasting speed, you should have good 'mana control'
skill, for the time of casting is based on it and the sp cost of the
syllabe. Without it even a simple spell will take very long to cast.
