  STATS

This help explains how the stats are calculated. The formula is:

  race_stat * (stat_gained_from_guilds% + stat_gained_from_eq%) = actual stat

Race_stat is the factor that is described in race helps. ie. giant's Str is excellent.
Stat_gained_from_guilds is the total of the bonuses what you have gained while
advancing in guilds. You can see the stat bonuses with 'info' command in a guild.

Stat_gained_from_eq is the total bonus from all eq you are wearing. This means
one piece of equipment can give DIFFERENT bonuses to different players, depending
of the player's race!

Example:
Celtron is a giant. This means his Str is excellent (90). He has some levels in
fighter's guild and a magical helm, that gives him a (3%) Str bonus.

  actual Str = (race_stat:90 * (guild_stats:51% + eq_stats:3%))
             = 90 * (0.51 + 0.03)
             = 90 * 0.54
             = 48.6

         Str ~ 48 (All decimal results are rounded down.)

This means the helm raises Celtron's Str by 90*00.3 = 2.7 ~= 2.
If Celtron were a hobbit then his racial Str would be much lower and so the helm
would raise less his Str.

NOTE: Usually when gaining a level you will get a percentual raise in all stats,
      except when the 'info' status of a guild says 'none' for the bonus of a stat.
