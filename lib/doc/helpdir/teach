Syntax: teach <skillname> to <player> 
Examples: teach attack to onarion

Skills are divided into two groups:
   1. Common skills
   2. Magic skills

Different races have different skill maximums in magic skill and common
skill categories. Skill maximum also depends on how hard the skills is to
learn.

Your racial max is passed when you get the message:
    'The knowledge of this skill is getting really difficult for you.'

This means that the skill cost (experience required) starts to increase
dramatically. Characters with a low worth aren't recommended to train their
skills over this limit. Syntax 'train <skill> to max' trains the skill 
to your racial max.

One cannot be teached when reincarnating.
