		One player teaching another

Both players must be in the guild that teaches the wanted skill.
The teaching player must naturally be more skilled. The advantage
is that the guild takes no training fee and the amount of experince
required is halved! This is because the student receives personal
teaching and detailed help.

Teaching with this method is possible only when training skills or
spells (not when advancing levels!). It's required also that the
teaching takes place when the player starts to increase his knowledge
of this skill. (Not possible when training with cost free experience!)

Because this method is very beneficial and cheap to the learning
player, the teacher might ask a small fee in return.

Look at the plaques in guilds for additional info about the syntax.
