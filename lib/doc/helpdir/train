Syntax: train <skillname> [to max | to <adjective>]
Examples: train attack to max
          train consider
          train bare hands to marvelous
	  
With this command you can start training skills in guilds. You can then
start to gather the experience points required to advance in the skill
knowledge.

Skills are divided into two groups:
   1. Common skills
   2. Magic skills

Different races have different skill maximums in magic skill and common
skill categories. Skill maximum also depends on how hard the skills is to
learn.

Your racial max is passed when you get the message:
    'The knowledge of this skill is getting really difficult for you.'

This means that the skill cost (experience required) starts to increase
dramatically. Characters with a low worth aren't recommended to train their
skills over this limit. Syntax 'train <skill> to max' trains the skill 
to your racial max.
