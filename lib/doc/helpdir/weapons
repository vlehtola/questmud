The weapons in QuestMud are divided into three classes:

I) Bludgeons, like clubs are usually used by dumb, strong creatures.
It is considered easy to master weapons of this kind. All low level
fighters are recommanded to first gain the knowledge on these weapons.

II) Bladed sword-like weapons are used by skilled warriors who count
more on their dexterity than raw force. These weapons tend to be more
efficient than plain blunt weapons.

III) Axes are feared, powerful weapons. The dreaded great axe delivers
massive damage to any creature. These weapons require great skill and
dedication. Without the proper knowledge axes tend to do more harm
than good to their user.

Weapons deliver three different damage types:
     bashing, slashing and piercing
Bleeding and other little side-effects are caused by these.

NOTE: If mauls do only bashing damage, this does not mean that
      an axe would do but slashing or bashing, but both types of damage.
