Whines about castigations imposed by archwizards should mainly be 
directed at the same wizards who set them, and only if you really
think that there is a dire need for a correction. Excessive whining
after being punished is a just cause to increase the sanctions.

Expect rm/zap/ban for whining about Arch's deeds to demigods or higher.
