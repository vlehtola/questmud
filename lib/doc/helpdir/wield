command: wield <weapon>

Wield is used for wielding weapons so that one can use them in
combat. When wielding a weapon, wield command checks if you can
wield the weapon.

If you don't have any weapons wielded, the weapon is wielded
in your right hand and if you are not strong and big enough,
in both hands. If you already have a weapon in your right hand and
try to wield another weapon it will be wielded in your left hand
if possible.

You need to have knowledge about two weapons combat if you want to
wield a weapon in your left hand. You should remember that your left
hand is weaker and you need more strength to wield a weapon in your
left hand than your right one. Also the weapon does less damage 
in left hand.

Shields are not weapons and are always wielded in left hand. You
cannot wield a shield if you already have a weapon in your left
hand (including weapons wielded in both hands).

See 'help wear' for using armours.
