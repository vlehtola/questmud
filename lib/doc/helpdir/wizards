QuestMud Wizards, Archs and Admins (updated 28.02.2008)


Immortals' duty is to keep the mud running and support new code to the system.
NO in-game secret will be revealed to you by wizards, ask your mortal friends.
(All attempts of whining, being a friend, bribery, etc will be ignored.
 Real-life threats lead to removal and contacting the authorities.)

The responsibilies are divided in the following way:

Apprentice wizards
  Their job is to code new areas to the world of Deleria.
  They are unable to help any mortals.

Wizards
  They have proven their worthiness to the mud by finishing areas or such.
  They are unable to help any mortals.

Adept wizards
  Their job is to provide basic user level maintenance and assistance in case
  the system bugs or malfuntions. They have rights to 'tune' areas, monsters, equipment
  and such. Adepts also have rights to punish any misbehavior such as cheating.

Archwizards
  Their job is the mud system maintenance and controlling lower level wizards.
  They have rights to do almost anything. Think carefully before whining
  about lower wizards' deeds to Archwizards, because it can lead to increasing
  the sentence.

Elders
  Formerly known as Gods, the upper admins of the mud. They support the 
  core system and mud hosting and also have responsibility of major 
  system changes. There are no restricions to their power.

 Here they are:
    Celtron: active  Nalle: inactive

 Who to ask about problems :

 Guilds
    -> Elders, Archs

 Areas, individual monsters, eq, quests etc.
    -> Adepts

  If you have questions, first ask your mortal friends for answers,
