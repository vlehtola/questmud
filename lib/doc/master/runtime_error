SYNOPSIS
        void runtime_error( string err, string prg, string curobj, int line
                      , mixed culprit)

DESCRIPTION
        This function has to announce a runtime error to the active
        user. If the user has enough privileges, it might give him the
        full error message together with the source line. Else it
        should issue a decent message ("Your sensitive mind notices a
        wrongness in the fabric of space").

    <err> is the error message, <prg> is the program executed (which
    might be an inherited program), <curobj> is the current object at the time
    of the error. <line> is the linenumber within the program.

    If the error is a normal runtime error, <culprit> is -1. Otherwise,
    the error occured during a heartbeat and <culprit> is the object which
    heart_beat() function was executed. Also, in case of a heartbeat error,
    the heartbeat for the <culprit> has been turned off.

    Note that any of the the objects or programs might be destructed, ie.
    might be passed as 0.

HISTORY
        LDMud 3.2.9 added the <culprit> argument.
