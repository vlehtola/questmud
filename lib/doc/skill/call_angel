Skill name: Call angel
Type: spellcasting skill
Usage: automatic

With this skill paladins channel the divine power of the gods to
summon forth an angel from the skies to aid their holy cause.
The power of the angel depends of the third syllabe aswell
as from the skills and level of the summoner.

The angel knows to cast most of the same spells than the paladin.
It follows the paladin until it's attacked or meets an other angel.
