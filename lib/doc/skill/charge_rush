Help on skill: Charge rush
Skill type: offensive
Usage duration: 2 rounds
Affecting stats: Str/Dex & Size

This skill allows you to charge blindly from a room to another
hitting every living being in the way. If a room contains more
than one living creature, charger collides only with one of them.
Charge continues until it ends naturally or is stopped by wall
or some creature that doesn't get killed by the impact.

If a creature survives the horrible impact, the berserker has
a chance of stunning him by the sudden charge, based on his
knowledge of the 'stun' skill.

You need to be in berserk to use this skill.
