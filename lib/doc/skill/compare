Help on skill: compare
Skill type: neutral
Usage duration: 5

Mortal men have always wanted to know many things about
their surroundings. Which axe hits the hardest, which chain
mail gives the best protection and so on. Many skilled
warriors have developed a way to compare different items.
With this skill a warrior can compare two weapons or two
armours. Warriors are not mages and thus this skill doesn't
compare magical properties of items. Note that even the
best warriors can make mistakes when comparing items so it's
good to have this skill trained to a high level before you
start sharing your information.
