Help on skill: critical
Skill type: offensive
Usage duration: automatic

A fighter may score a critical hit to some special part of body.
Hitting to vital parts highly increases the damage.
Only the armour protecting the current part of body will be noticed when
calculating the damage. Powerful hits with this skill can
even separate limbs from weak bodies.
