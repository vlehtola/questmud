Help on skill: defend
Skill type: defensive
Usage duration: special

This skill increases your defensive capabilities for a short time.
Use the 'combat' command to check your combat attributes.
While entering the defensive mode, your whole fighting technique
changes. Parrying becomes the whole meaning of close encounter while
if failed the dodging attempt focuses on retreating and avoiding hits.
The higher parry and dodge skill knowledge you have, the better
they will work. At 'outstanding' skill levels the defender is practically
impossible to hit while he is defending himself or his party.
The duration of the defensive stance is not reduced while you are
not in combat, although the duration shortens after each succesfully
avoided hit. You can break the defensive stance by typing 'use defend'.
Your skill knowledge affects the skill's duration.
