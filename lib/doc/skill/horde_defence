Help on skill: horde defence
Skill type: neutral
Usage duration: 5
Affecting stats: int

Sometimes a necromancer faces some enemies that will
strike beyond his horde. Those enemies are a great
threat to even the most experienced necromancers.
This skill allows the necromancer to command his
horde to defend him at any costs thus making him
almost invulnerable for a little while.
