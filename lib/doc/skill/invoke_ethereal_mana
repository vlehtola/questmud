Skill name: Invoke ethereal mana
Type: mana saving skill
Usage: automatic

Natural resistances of creatures reduce the effectiveness of spells.
This means part of the mana used on spell is wasted and returned
back to the primal sources.
Invoking ethereal mana calls upon these sources of raw mana,
establishing a link that draws the 'lost' mana from the outer sources
back to the caster.
This skill restores an amount of mana equal to the mana used in boost
times the percentage of target's resistance.
This skill works only for offensive spells.
