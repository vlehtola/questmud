Skill name: Mental unity
Usage: automatic

When several spellcasters share a common interest they may
form a mental unity to benefit from each other increasing
their mana regeneration. The benefit gained for each player
is proportional to the sum of players' skill.
This skill works only when two or more players with this
skill are in a party and same location.
