Help on skill: parry
Skill type: defensive
Usage duration: automatic
Affecting stats: Str

You must wield a weapon or a shield for parrying. Parry helps you
to block enemy's hits in combat, thus taking less damage. If the
enemy is a lot stronger than you, parrying doesn't help too much.
The command 'defence' gives you information about your defence.

NOTE: Artist knuckles are not counted as parrying weapons.
