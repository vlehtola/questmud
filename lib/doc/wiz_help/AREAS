Some general info about coding areas: (last updated 24.2.2001)

- No jokes.

- No referals to real life or other fantasy literature/games.
  ie. copying names is illegal. copying ideas and themes while changing names
      to own created ones is legal.

- Do not use words 'you' or 'there' on room/item/monster desriptions!
  (ok, one time in a desc is allowable, but not when every phrase starts with one of these.)

- Do not use several periods or questionmarks in descriptions. One is enough.
  ie. "The path continues..." or "What might be behind that door???" or "He's bleeding!!!!"
 *Second point: do not write questions in the descriptions. _Underlining_ is not approved either.

- If you do rooms with same descs, try to put the desctext in one separate file from where it is called by rooms.
  It's easier to change one desc than multiple copies of it (in case of typos etc).

- All areas are supposed to be based on race help descs. If one doesn't fit in our realm, it won't be opened.

- Preferably no bad english, typos etc. don't write too hastily, descs create the feeling.

- Don't be shy to ask for help, it's better (and easier) to fix things sooner than later.

- Quests. Do them. The acting code for marking the quest done for a player:
      this_player()->set_quest("Rescue the princess from the dragon's cave");
  NOTE!! Archwizs must validate your quest before it really adds the QP's.

!! CHECK YOUR BUGREPORT FILE! Type: more /log/<yourname>.rep !!
!! CHECK YOUR EQ MONSTERS! They must reset only ONCE per boot. !!
!! CHECK YOUR MONSTERS! Remove the "set_money", it doesn't work. !!

Have a nice day,
