If you don't like messing with ed (i bet you don't) try using tiny-
fungues file transfer macros. 
  /load filexfer.tf loads the xfer macro from your tflib (it should be there)
  /getfile_lp <file> downloads a file <file> to your unix system
  /putfile_lp <file> uploads a file <file> to your unix system

  see /help getfile and /help putfile for more help.

  when downloaded to your unix system, you can edit the files with pico or emacs or
  with some other editor and then upload them back.
