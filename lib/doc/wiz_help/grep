Command:  grep "<search string>" <filename>
          Find a string in a file.

Examples: grep "test" test.c
          grep "search string" test.c
          grep "int" * 
          grep "int" *.c
          grep "int" _gr*
          grep "int" _gr*.c
          grep "test" /doc/misc
          grep "test" /doc/misc/
          grep "test" /doc/misc/liv*
          grep "test" /doc/misc/living.c

          grep "test" test/te*
          grep "test" cmds
                       ^
          This being a directory name in your current path.

          All of the above work. However...

          grep search string test.c 
 
          Does not. You must enclose your search string
          with quotation marks. Nor does...
 
          grep "test" *test*
 
          get_dir() can't handle double wildcards.

          grep will now support wildcards AND directories.
          It will NOT however do recursive directories due
          to possible severe lag.

          Using grep on too large files or stack of files
          and exceeding an output of 4800 rows will cause
          the MUD to cut off your output. So make sure you
          have an accurate enough search string.

This command was introduced to the game in 2004-01-14.
