SUMMONING

1. Choose place and prepare the summoning (draw circles)

2. Cast self-protective spells
- if not cast, the demon can attack the caster at later stage
- all protections wear off if the caster moves. if controlling fails, has the caster
  the nerve to stay still (how to work quit and ld?)

3. Call for demon until succees (time and effort taken is random)
- failure is possible, random effect (often nothing but waste of time and sp) 
- calling for 'wrong' and too high demons is lethal.
- possible to summon multiple demons by will or by accident (ouch)

4. Cast controllitive spells on demon (At the moment of summoning)
- failure is possible, demon starts raging and tries to harm the caster
- demons can do many other nasty things than just kill:
  *permanently lower stats, skills, destroy eqs, banish (yes!), drain experience etc

5. Secure the control wards (check that the control is active)


NOTE: because stupid ppl can fuck up their characters more or less in this guild,
NOTE: ALL HAVE TO BE WARNED BEFORE THEY CAN REINC TO JOIN!!

The guild is not dangerous if one uses caution and does not do stupid things.
