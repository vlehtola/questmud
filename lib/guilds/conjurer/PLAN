GENERAL IDEA


Focuses on summoning demons and other creatures/servants/monsters from
other planes of existance.

Conjurers use their summoned minions to complete their wished tasks.
This is often simplified as making xp. Therefore making of useless
features should be avoided as normally. Main focus should be concentrated
in making the xping progress complicated and thus intellectually more
stimulating than in other guilds/muds.

Minions fall into following subgroups
*familiar/servant: obediant, easy to control, lifelink, xplink
*roamer: minimal control, wandering, aggressive, xplink
*destructive: cannot be controlled, wandering, aggressive
*posessive: hunts the target, noncorporeal, weakens the victim (vulnerability-like)
*more ideas?

The master must specify the plane and the name of the will-be-summoned demon or other creature.
Information about the planes and names are considered secret.
The planes&names need a separate database daemon.
(how to get the info? should it be different for every player?)

Legend
xplink = the xp gained by caster or minion are divided for both by a ratio
lifelink = the damage taken by minion reduces the caster's hit points aswell and vice versa
	   option: only the death of minion reduces the caster's hp.
control = the master has some means to control it's minions. preferably spells.
          the measures can be taken before, at the time of and after the summoning.
          other means (from other guilds) like force fields are considered valid options.


SPECIFICATIONS


*Conjurers are to be a base guild with several subguilds.
*Each sub (including the base) would be ~5-15 levels.
*Total of ~50-80 levels (?)

*spellbased guild. only few usable skills.
