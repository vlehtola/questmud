Transfering health was invented accidentally when an ancient cleric
fumbled the 'life drain' spell. This spell transfers some of the caster's
health to the target. The hit points restored to the target equals five
times the health lost by caster. If caster's hit points drop to one (1),
the spell ceases to function (you cannot suicide with this spell).
Otherwise the healing amount is calculated by the same formula than
the spell 'heal'.
