These spells try to summon demons from the planes of chaos.
Demons that might answer to your summoning attempts can 
even attack the summoner if he/she aren't well protected.
You will also have to archieve higher in the ranks of warlocks
before you can even think about summoning higher demons.
It is rumoured that the cathedral of chaos has a summoning
chamber that will help you to summon something much easier.
