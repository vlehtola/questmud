NAME
	call_out - delayed execution of a function
	
SYNOPSIS
	void call_out(string func, int delay, void|mixed arg)

DESCRIPTION
	With this function you can delay the call of a name function
	`func' for `delay' seconds. If `arg' is specified it is passed
	as an argument to the function.

NOTA BENE
	this_player() is kept intact when the function is called. If you
	know what you are doing you can trust this_player() and write
	instructions.

	The smallest time-unit in the game is a heartbeat (2 seconds). 
	This means that even though you might specify an odd-second delay, 
	it will	still be executed on a full heartbeat (even second).
