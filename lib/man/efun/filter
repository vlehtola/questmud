NAME
	filter - filter an array or a mapping through a specific 
		 filter function

SYNOPSIS
	mixed *filter(int foobar|mixed *arr|mapping map, string filter, 
			    object ob|string ob, void|mixed extra)

DESCRIPTION
	This function is used to filter all items in an array or a mapping
	through a specific function. The resulting array or mapping contains
	all elements in the original array or mapping that the function
	`filter' returned 1 for while all those that a 0 was returned for
	was discarded.

	If an integer is given as argument instead of an array or mapping,
	0 is returned.

	`filter' is simply given as a string with the name of the filter
	function to use.

	`ob' is either the actual object that contains the filter function
	or a path to to the object.

	`extra' can be any argument that you would like the `filter' 
	function to recieve as argument.
