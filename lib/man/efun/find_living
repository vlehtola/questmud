NAME
	find_living - find a named living object

SYNOPSIS
	object find_living(string name)

DESCRIPTION
	This function returns the living object with the given `name'.

	The argument `name' must be given in lowercase for this function
	to work.

NOTA BENE
	For this function to work, the object must have added its name 
	to the game-driver internal list by calling the function 
	`set_living_name()'. Just making it living with `enable_commands()'
	is not enough.

SEE ALSO
	set_living_name, enable_commands, find_player, find_object
