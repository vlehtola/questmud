NAME
	input_to - redirect keyboard input to a function

SYNOPSIS
	void input_to(string func, void|int noecho, void|mixed arg)

DESCRIPTION
	With this function it is possible to redirect the keyboard
	input from a player into a function.

	The function `func' is then called with the string the player
	wrote as argument. If `noecho' is given and is non-zero, the string 
	is not echoed on the player's screen.
	You can pass an argument to the input_to function by specifying it 
	after the noecho argument. please note that you have to noecho
	(as 0 or an other value) if you want to specify the extra arg.

NOTA BENE
	This only works for interactive players. This will not work
	for an npc of any kind.
