NAME
	map - map a function onto each element of an array or a mapping

SYNOPSIS
	mixed *map(int foobar|mixed *array|mapping map, string map,
			 object ob|string ob, mixed extra)

DESCRIPTION
	This function is used to process all items in an array or a mapping
	through a specific function. The resulting array or mapping contains
	whatever was returned by the `map' function.

	If an integer is given as argument instead of an array or mapping,
	0 is returned.

	`map' is simply given as a string with the name of the processing
	function to use.

	`ob' is either the actual object that contains the filter function
	or a path to to the object.

	`extra' can be any argument that you would like the `map' 
	function to recieve as argument.
