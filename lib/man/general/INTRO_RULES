The Lpmud game is very complex. Virtually any situation or idea may be
put into code. Because of this there has to be rules that defines what
a wizard may do and what he may not do.

Since the potential of the game is so great, we have endeavored to
separate the rules into sections that relate to just a single subject.
However there are some very general rules relating to all wizards that
can't be put solely into one of these subjects. They relate to all and
all must follow them. It is those rules you will find in this section.

Rules for all wizards
=====================

As you became a wizard, the game as such came to an end. Accept that
now and you will have no trouble in the future. You are no longer a
part of the ordinary quest for experience and should have no such 
contact with the game in the future.

A wizard may not help or harass a player in the game. The only help a
wizard may offer is information on how to play the game, i.e. how the
mechanics of the game work, which commands are available etc. Hints
on quests, where to find equipment etc is expressly forbidden. Any
restorations or modifications of experience or equipment etc should be
handled by the Archwizards. Socializing is acceptable only if it is
made on the terms of the mortal in question. Their right to privacy
and enjoyment of the game must be respected.

All wizards have a test character available in the game. The name of
that test character is the same as the wizard but with a "jr" appended.
You can log this test character on as soon as you become wizard by
using the same password as your normal character. If there should be a
need for more than one test character, be certain to make him
immediately identifiable as a testcharacter by his name. This
testcharacter must be played as if he were a wizard, with the same
rules applying to him. A wizard may not introduce a "test wizard".
All test characters must be mortals. 

You are supposed to use your test character to test out any code you
produce before making it available to the mortals. On _NO_ account may
you invite a mortal to test your area. This invariably ends with the
mortal being killed, loosing equipment and you getting demoted for
carelessness.

All code produced must be of benefit to the game. A wizard may not write
code that is intended to harass another player or wizard. Code that
is intended to be of use to only a small number of people, like wizard
tools or special wizard rooms should be kept to an absolute minimum.
Be sure that you can motivate it before writing it. Ego-inflating code
like unique wizard-weaponry or armour etc is not allowed. We can use
the diskspace in a far more productible way even if you can't.

The game is set in "the long distant past". Because of this all
descriptions and messages of _any_ kind in the game should give the
player the feeling of a medieval setting. There simply may not exist
anything that even remotely sounds modern, not even in places where a
mortal never may see it.

Breaking of rules
=================

Generally if you break a rule this leads just to a warning and the
demotion of one or more levels. Remember though, that when you loose
your last level you will find yourself back in the game as a very novice
mortal and you will have to play your way back up to wizardhood again.

If the offense is considered to have been sheer hooliganism you might
be expelled from the game entirely. In case of such a drastic action,
the Archwizards must also consider possible actions of revenge from
you and they might deem it necessary to exclude your site entirely
from the game. 

Specific rules for the game
===========================

All rules concerning the game as such may be found in the other files
in this directory. It's a very good idea to read through them all once
just to get an idea of what is allowed and not. Later when you want to
add things to the game you can read through the relevant files more 
carefully. Remember that not knowing about a rule is _no_ excuse for
breaking it.
