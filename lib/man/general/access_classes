FUNCTIONS

private - If a function is declared private, it can't be accessed by
          inheriting files, shadows or call_others.

static - If a function is declared static it can't be accessed by shadows
         or call_others. It can be masked.

nomask - If a function is declared nomask it can't be redifined by an inherit
         or a shadow.

VARIABLES

private - A private variable can not be accessed by inheriting files.

static - A static variable will not be saved to file by a save_object()
         function call. Neither will it be restored by a restore_object().

The different access classes can be combined.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Value_by_function_call (VBFC) is always considered to be a call_other.

An explicit call_other to this_object() is considered to be a true call_other.

Function parameters to "filter" and "map" are call_other unless the object
parameter to the filter/map function is this_object().

Input_to and call_out are internal calls, so they can access private and
static functions.
