This document describes how teams work in 3.0

Background
==========

There has been very little support for teams in the game before version 3.0.
Teams are basically an idea from the world of roleplaying. When players
cooperate the game should support group movement and sharing of xp.


Implementation in 3.0
=====================

There are team leaders and team members. Teams are not limited to players, any
living object can join a team. The basic routines in /std/living allows any
mix in a team, however in the player files and in the npc files there are
guards against mixed teams, so no mixed player/NPC teams are allowed.

There are three basic routines in all living objects to handle teams:

	set_leader(leader_object);  /* Sets the leader to leader_object */
	team_join(member_object);   /* Adds this member to my team */
	team_leave(member_object);  /* Removes this member from my team */

Players have the commands:

	"invite member_name"    -- To let another player join my team
	"join leader_name"      -- To join a team.
	"leave leader_name"     -- To leave a team.
	"leave member_name"     -- To force a member out of your team


Consequences in the game
========================

Team members move by following their leader. Teams share every xp gained by 
anyone in the team. However, this is only true if the team members are in
the same room. So, two rules:

	- If your leader is in your room, and the leader moves, you follow.
	- If a member of a team gains xp, it is shared by all members in the
	  room.


Further development
===================

The concept of teams will be developed further. The stat 'DIS' disciplin will
be used for deciding who can lead whom. It will also for the leader be
affected by the teams success or failure. It will not be good for a leaders
'DIS' if a member of the team dies.
