/*
 * Function name: actor
 * Defined in   : /cmd/std/command_driver.c
 * Description  : This function will send a message to the living that
 *                performs an action. It will handle met-nonmet. The third
 *                argument is optional. If it is omitted, it will be set to
 *                the string "." and in all cases \n will be added. Obviously
 *                you will have to be able to see the target in order to
 *                perform an action on someone, but that has to be checked
 *                before. (It is checked if you use parse_this)
 * Arguments    : string str1
 *                object *oblist
 *                string str2
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * actor("You hug", oblist);     (no space before at the end of str1)
 *
 * "You hug Fatty."
 * "You hug the big fat gnome."
 *
 * actor("You kiss", oblist, " gently.");    (a space preceding str2)
 *
 * "You kiss Fatty gently."
 * "You kiss the big fat gnome gently."
