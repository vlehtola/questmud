/*
 * Function name: all
 * Defined in   : /cmd/std/command_driver.c
 * Description  : This function will send a message to all other players
 *                in the room. This function will handle met-nonmet and
 *                seen-unseen. Note therefor that this message should also
 *                be noticeble by players that cannot see this_player(), so
 *                all(" smiles") isn't a good idea. Otherwize use allbb();
 * Artuments    : string str - the message to display.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * all(" giggles merrily.");       (Note the preceding space.)
 *
 * "Fatty giggles merrily."
 * "The big fat gnome wizard giggles merrily."
 * "Someone giggles merrily."
