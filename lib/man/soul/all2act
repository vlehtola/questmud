 *
 *   oblist = ({ Mrpr })
 * "Fatty hugs the darkly robed human wizard."
 * "The big fat gnome wizard hugs Mrpr."
 * "Fatty hugs someone."
 *
 *   oblist = ({ Mrpr, Mercade })
 * "Fatty hugs the darkly robed human wizard and Mercade."
 * "The big far gnome wizard hugs Mrpr and someone."
 * "Fatty hugs someone and the friendly dour dwarf wizard."
 *
 * all2act("thanks", oblist, " gratefully.");    (a space preceding str2)
