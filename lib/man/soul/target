/*
 * Function name: target
 * Defined in   : /cmd/std/command_driver.c
 * Description  : This function displays a message to all targets of an
 *                action. It will handle met-nonmet and seen-unseen. This
 *                means that actions that cannot be seen by the target,
 *                like wave, should be handled by another function. Use
 *                targetbb() for that.
 * Arguments    : string str     - the string to display
 *                object *oblist - the targets to display to
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * target(" hugs you.");     (Note the preceding space)
 * 
 * "Mrpr hugs you."
 * "The darkly robed human wizard hugs you."
 * "Someone hugs you."
