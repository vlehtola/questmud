A huge ogre bandit
A large sized ogre bandit who is dispite of his size an excellent fighter. When he
attacks most of the victims totally freeze from fear and are an easy kill. The lust
of blood and gold have made the ogre blind from anything else in life and the only
way to live for him is to raid travellers.
