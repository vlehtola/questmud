An ugly troll villain
A hairy and ugly troll who by accident, when wandering in the woods, met the others
of his kind; the villains, who raid travellers who are lost in the forests. Large
bruises and cut wounds can be seen through the thick layer of hair and there is
no doubt that he isn't an excellent fighter.
