A strong troll villain
A sturdy and muscular troll villain. He has an evil smile on his bruised face and
a determined look in his deep, dark eyes. He was banished from his home village
because of his never ending lust of treasures and now he is fulfilling his dreams
in the dark forests of Deleria.
