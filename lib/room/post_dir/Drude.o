The only proper way to quit the MUD is\nto use 'safe_quit' in the inn. Going link-dead definitely isn't the way\n(even though it might work on other MUDS)\nDrude\n\n**\nDrude\n**\n Re:   Money\nCc: mystery\nDate: Jul 15\n\nAs a reward for your good savings I've transfered another 30000 bronze to\nyour account. Keep them and use them to good purposes and don't ever whine\nto me that you're short of cash ...               ;-)\n\nDrude\n\nNB. just by selling equip from the knights I've killed I've earned about\n80000 bronze coins in a few weeks and I don't have many good purposes any\nmore to use my coins for.\n\n**\nDrude\n**\nSubj: ld\n\nCc: trooper\nDate: Dec  6\n\nHi, \n\n Normally, going linkdead won't help you a bit.\nI don't know if the game will reboot before. It probably won't and you'll\nnot have lost your equipment.\nOtherwise, it's not safe to go 'ld' with eq on you ...\n\nCheers, Drude\n\n**\nDrude\n**\nSubj: bug reports\n\nCc: grathlek\nDate: Dec  8\n\nNice, wasn't it those bug report files ?\n\nI can't remember anymore which bug reports might have gone to you.\nBut if it was about the necromancer guild then yes there is something\nwrong in the code somewhere.\nBut I guess my bug reports should be clear enough about that.\n\nWould be quite nice to have a real defender defend a horde :)\n\nCheers, Drude\n\n**\nDrude\n**\nSubj: playing\n\nCc: atreyu\nDate: Dec  9\n\nHiya,\n\nI've been in the game for some time again. Also waiting a bit for you\nto provide your clerical services.\nSo when do you think you'll be playing again?\nI might not be playing tomorrow (friday) and also some days next week\nprobably not both 16 and 17 december.\nJust mail be back or whatever on the times that you'll be here.\n\nCheers, Drude\n\n**\nDrude\n**\nSubj: eq\n\nCc: rehti\nDate: Jan 31\n\nHi,\n\nYou told me something last time so here is the answer (more-or-less)\n\nIron leggings best protection possible, some of the other leggings give\nequally good protection but only caster stats\n\nAgain iron bracers give very good protection .. only burning bracers exist\nwhich are slightly better but also caster eq\n\n\nDefinitely necklace of wolfking is best though no necklace gives any protection\n\nNothing new here .. iron plate mail is best, there is still plate of spirit\nwhich gives equal protection but that again is caster-eq. There is fighter\nplate but that gives lousy protection and little stats. Actually Dequan\nplate is best of those fighter plates.\n\nSo I don't know why caster-eq gives so good protection but somehow nobody\nthought of making real fighter-eq ...\n\nCheers, Drude\n\n**\nDrude\n**\nSubj: guilds (additional)\n\nCc: proge\nDate: May  3\n\nThe Weaponmaster guild (10 levels) trains the following stats:\nStr: some       Dex: some       Con: a little\nInt: a
