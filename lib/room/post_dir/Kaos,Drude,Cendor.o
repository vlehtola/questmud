Cendor\non the mud-channel and am very curious what it is precisely that you're\ntalking about concerning the bugs that you're encountering.\n\nThis MUD more or less seems a mess without any highlevel arches or wizzes\non. Like Cendor who's willing enough to help and also seems to have the\nskills to program but doesn't have the access to change the code.\nSo what are the bugs you've encountered? ... and which are killing you...\n\nThe ones I've found so far is that my 'consider' skill has gone from\n'outstanding' to '0' whatever that may mean ... I can still use it at least.\nA nasty one I've found out about is that when I'm necro and I tank for my\nhorde (or the mobile attacks me first) that in the end it just won't die\nand of course my horde won't follow either since it is so bloodthursty.\nEnd of the tale is that I've got to start a new horde all over again .. the\nmonster just won't take any damage anymore even when I'm asking friendly\nmages to blast it.\n\nWell would be nice hearing from you. Cheers,   Drude\n\n**\n"
