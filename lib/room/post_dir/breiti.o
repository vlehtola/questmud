messages "Nalle\n**\nSubj: nosave-mode\n\nDate: Apr 22\n\nG'day, I am sorry I could not reply, but I was idle then, but with a few triggers running. No save means, in this case that we have a slight problem with reboot, thus some players exp/eq do not \"reappear\" after reboot. This is a temporary problem only ans should be gone most shortly. The wizards thought players would like an official \"no-save\" so that they would know not to concetrate their playing on this period in time. Please do not bother the other wizards about this, they will not tell you anything I didn't. Any information in this mail may be declared incorrect by other wizards or myself in the future, so please do not make a fuss about this. \nWe are working hard to solve this problem. //Nalle\n\n**\nAir\n**\nSubj: tach :)\n\nDate: May 25\n\nich werd spaeter heute hier sein,(so gegen 7 oder 8 deine zeit spaetestens),und dann wohl die ganze woche so.ill go cleric if needed and we do serious exp :)\nhoffe du bist gut uebers saufgelage gekommen :)\nbis spaeter,Air\n\n**\nGrathlek\n**\n Re:   leornic's burning bracers\nDate: Jun 11\n\nHeh the id is bracelets and leornic has no heal spell\nmaybe he heals so fast because in this mudlib monsters have very good\nhp regen.\n\n**\nOnarion\n**\nSubj: pius's post\n\nDate: Dec  2\n\nDo you agree with pius, or what was the general post about?\nClerics will be opening soon.\nTell me what you think about all this.\n\nOnarion\n\n**\nOnarion\n**\nSubj: bug report\n\nDate: Feb  2\n\nplease dont post bug report in news, mail them directly to me/celtron.\nah for the bug, it is a bug and you will be reimbursed\nas for the bug that is..\n\nOnarion\n\n**\nOnarion\n**\nSubj: bug\n\nDate: Feb  2\n\ni would also appreciate if you would remember if you were training anything the time you took the reinc, and did you have free exp already?\n\n**\nOnarion\n**\nSubj: bug.. again :)\n\nDate: Feb  2\n\n\nwell im putting 3g for you.. \n\n**\nCeltron\n**\nSubj: exp bug\n\nCc: onarion\nDate: Feb  2\n\nyes your total worth seems to bug.\ncontact us (gods), when you're online.\n/Celtron\n\n**\n"
