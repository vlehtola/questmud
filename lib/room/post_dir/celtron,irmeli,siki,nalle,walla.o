But it can be even nicer when the\nspells in the spellbook are sorted in some way. And I can think of\ntwo ways that can be useful:\nFor instance, you can sort the spells in alphabetical order on the\nname of the spell .. like\nabcra\nbacra\ncarba\netc..\n\nOr you can sort them, in alphabetical order on the last spellword like\nexs brr blt\nexs fla blt\nexs sol blt\nexs zzt blt\nexs brr zum\netc..\n\nThat last way has the advantage that you can see very fast which spells\nare still missing in the spellbook\nThe other has the advantage that if some sells a scroll that you can\nsee very fast if you already have that scroll in your spellbook.\n\nhaving a sorted order in any case will help.\n\nTHank you, atreyu\n\n**\n"
