It has become impossible now as a mortal to post any news\nto any of the news groups ... making the news group wanted especially\ncompletely unuseful.\nFurthermore, I wasn't able to mail to you directly using:\n'mail celtron,onarion' that is why i've tried it like this ...\n\nThe thing that I want some attention for and of which I don't know if\nthe message has reached you already is the following item which I tried\nto put on the news groups before:\nEspecially the wizzes! I've found a very clear bug and am able to proof it.\nRecently there have been big changes to the MUD without any announcements,\none of which shows the exp one receives, like You receive 120 exp... etc.\nI noticed that 'summary' and 'party status' gave completely different info,\nso I killed one big mob. When it died I received 1169208 exp-points and\n'summary showed this number, also the plaque was updated by the same amount.\nBut 'party status' showed a lot more, namely also the exp that I had gained\nby hitting the mob loads of times, which is the correct amount.\nPlz, make it so that all exp is correctly summed up in the 'summary' and\nexp-plaque (or change it back how it was originally ;)\nCheers, Drude\n\n**\n"
