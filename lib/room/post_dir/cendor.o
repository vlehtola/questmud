Okay I made the mistake of\ncasting a spell after my horde had killed the monster but still that is\nno good reason for it to suddenly start attacking me after I'd fled \naway ...\n\nThings like that have happened a few times today to me .. but mostly the\nhorde suddenly wouldn't follow me so I could type 'stop'\n\nMaybe this could help to make the necro code bug less ...\nCheers, Drude\n\n**\n"
