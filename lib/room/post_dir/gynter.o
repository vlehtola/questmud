Also if you happen to find\na compiled/source java telnet client we could use for please let me know.\nNo rush, but please send me mail when that's done. The font thing being\nthe most important thing.\n-Nalle.\n\n**\nNalle\n**\nSubj: WWW\n\nDate: Feb  9\n\nGave you some levels for the WWW pages and promoted you to wiz 3 arch.\nIt would be nice if you could look after the pages a bit (I realize\nyou don't have access atm, but if you have new stuff or notice something\nis out of date you can send me mail or tell etc.) Archs also have some\ndisciplinary rights and general access, you're prolly familiar with that\nstuff.\nCheers,\n-N\n\n**\nNalle\n**\nSubj: area\n\nDate: Mar  8\n\nAdded the data to area_entry_d and quest_d, send some news-post\nabout the area etc, you knwo the drill.
