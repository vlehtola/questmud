Sadly\nenough I've tested it and the target regenerates just as fast .. the only\ndifference it makes is that a heal spell doesn't have any effect. Well,\nI know of only one or two mobs that heal themselves so this spell seems\nto be a bit of a waiste like that. On the other hand, normal mobs\nregenerate hps quite fast so it seems a good idea to me that when the\n'chl alr les' spell is casted on a mob the speed of regeneration is\nreduced a lot.\nPlease tell me if you don't like the idea, cheers Drude\n\n**\n"
