I explained clear enough to you that keep away from eq monsters.\nI wait for your response, but it is clear that there can be only one explanation.\nYou are certainly not a good tester, you dissapoint me.\n//Celtron\n\n**\nCeltron\n**\nSubj: testing\n\nDate: Apr 11\n\nIt seems that you did way over of what can be considered balanced rate.\nI assume that you have gained ~150M exp in less than 12 hours.\nThere's no way to check if you really trashed those eq, but maybe i'll let it be.\nYou said that you had a party, then again if you DID do like 80M exp in that party..\nwell the others got also a lot.\n\nI'm thankful, for you have tested necros way over my expectations, but sill\n(sill = still) the idea was that i'd tune the horde after one or two hours of\nout of tune expmaking or so. Since i wasn't in the game (timelag) you had a lot of time\nto test the old horde. The new horde requires testing, not the old one.\n\nI have made some changes to the horde. Some improvements and fixing and tune.\nThere seems to be however a major bug concerning the horde, the horde doesn't\nseem to hit in combat at all! This is very weird and i'm trying to solve it.\nTesting will be ceased until i find the problem (no idea to test something\nthat is not working). So feel free to reinc out, we'll resume the testing later.\n\nAbout those eqmob kills, i get upset if people disobey my requests.\nI do not disturb any mortals (interrupt their playing or tease them).\nAn other matter are cheaters (bug abuse, robots) of course and test players\nwho are supposed to act as normal players, but do as they are told so that\nthe testing could be efficient and benefical to the mud.\nTest playing is volontary as i have explained, you did well but next time\nyour testing credibility will drop under zero permanently.\n\nPerhaps i wasn't clear with my wish, but that is now history and not relevant.\n\nResume your normal playing, i'll contact you when the testing can be continued.\n//Celtron\n\n**\nGyver\n**\nSubj: this mud\n\nDate: Apr 12\n\nI want to be in the top 10 of this mud. muahaha\n\n**\nCeltron\n**\nSubj: necro test\n\nDate: Apr 13\n\nReinc out of necros, the testing will be stopped until i get the hb bug fixed.\n//Celtron\n\n**\n"
