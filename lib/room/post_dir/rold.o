So whent he was done his reinc, he didnt find his eqs. We know that YOU were unidle on that moment. We had severes suspects, but one evidence gave us thought that you'd taken his eqs. Trooper hunted all unilded players then and when he found you, you ran away and quitted. I notify you that you're on my enemy list from this moment. I will kill you when you come online unless there's away to prove you innocence ot by returning the eq you took. You have been warned. Thiefing is one thing that is not tolerabled in here!\n\n**\n"
