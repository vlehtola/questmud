Anyway, since you don't seem like playing too much, you could as well make some areas.\n\n**\nCeltron\n**\nSubj: necro ranks\n\nDate: Apr 25\n\n7 ranks and\ni'd like you to run through the necro subs and pick 10 different skills\nthat state the rank. i mean vital skills, min 1 from every sub.\n..this is if you want to do it.\nit'd take me one minute to make the ranks operational after you are done.\n//Celtron\n\n**\nDrude\n**\nSubj: bugs in game\n\nCc: Kaos,Drude,Cendor\nDate: Jul 13\n\n\n   Hiya,\n\nIt seems we're playing in different timezones so we don't meet eachother\nin the MUD very often but I've noticed your conversations with eg. Cendor\non the mud-channel and am very curious what it is precisely that you're\ntalking about concerning the bugs that you're encountering.\n\nThis MUD more or less seems a mess without any highlevel arches or wizzes\non. Like Cendor who's willing enough to help and also seems to have the\nskills to program but doesn't have the access to change the code.\nSo what are the bugs you've encountered? ... and which are killing you...\n\nThe ones I've found so far is that my 'consider' skill has gone from\n'outstanding' to '0' whatever that may mean ... I can still use it at least.\nA nasty one I've found out about is that when I'm necro and I tank for my\nhorde (or the mobile attacks me first) that in the end it just won't die\nand of course my horde won't follow either since it is so bloodthursty.\nEnd of the tale is that I've got to start a new horde all over again .. the\nmonster just won't take any damage anymore even when I'm asking friendly\nmages to blast it.\n\nWell would be nice hearing from you. Cheers,   Drude\n\n**\nOnarion\n**\nSubj: Hi\n\nDate: Nov 14\n\nIts been a while, eh.\n\nIve been now for more than 4 months in the military, and before that played Tribes fulltime. I think its time i pay some attention to our forever-project. Suddenly i feel really bad having ignored this for that long.. well its time to make it up heh :)\n\nTell me about any major bugs that would need to be fixed and anything that would need to be done.\n\nOnarion\n\n\n**\n"
