messages "Walla\n**\nSubj: ideas\n\nDate: Dec 21\n\nThis is pretty much a direct loan from another person on another mud, but\nI think it pretty well sums up what I intend to say\n \nIf you truly wish for something to happen, like those weapons, try to refine\nyour idea somewhat further. Just going 'give us these' isn't very inspiring,\nand it doesnt answer to the most important question. The question being \"why?\".\nIf you do not wish to answer the other important questions, please do take the\ntime to answer that particular one at least to raise intrest.\n \nWhat im getting at, is that although any idea with \"code this\", might be fine,\nmost wizards can come up with such ideas all by themselves, so what makes your\nidea special and worth doing?.\n \nHeres a list of a few other things I'd personally like to know when someone\nsuggests an idea of a race/guild/skill/weapontype/whatever:\n \n1) Why should it be done, whats special about it?\n2) Where does it fit in the scheme of things, if its an offensive skill, what\nis its purpose in a mud with dozens of such skills already, besides some\nnew messages and generally being \"cool\"\n3) Who should get this skill/whatever, and why do just _they_ need something\nextra?\n4) Would it make some other thing(skill/etc) useless by existing, and if yes,\nis it all around a better system of things than the replaced one.\n5) How does it improve this mud?\n \nFor the last question, suitable answers wouldnt be \"itd make guild x suck\n\nFor the last question, suitable answers wouldnt be \"itd make guild x suck;less\", or \"itd improve my rate\", or itd make thing Y and Z\n useful again.\nIn my opinion, should you state such claims, itd have more weight if you said\nwhy things Y and Z are useless as they are, and what the effect of the system\nyou are proposing to them would be.\n \n \nAnd finally, if you think this is all too much trouble to go through just to\nsuggest something, consider the trouble spent coding a suggestion like this.\n \n \n-Walla\n\n**\n"
