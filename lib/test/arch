To gain the rank of a 'archwizard' you need to pass this test.
You can use your own coding from your areas.

1. Build a command which lists all players under level 50 of
   a race given as an argument. (use users() efun, query_race()
   and query_level())

2. Make an eq monster which casts spells, uses specials and is
   a part (end?) of some quest. Give it suitable equipments.

3. Code one shadow which modifies given player's int. (use query_int())

4. Do a list which enlists the number of times every player
   does something (enters a room, uses secret passage).
   Use mapping ([ (string) player_name, (int) times ]).
   The list daemon must save it's data to disk and load it
   when activated after reboot.
