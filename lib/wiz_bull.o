Since this isn't possible at the moment for some reason\nhow else then are we supposed to use them since the help-files clearly state\nthat one should try and gain questpoints.\n\nThat's all, Drude\n\nNB. might it be a good idea to transform them into tps??\n\n\n**\nThanks for the wizzes who made the second locker room work bug-free.\nFinally the change to store both a complete fighter and a complete mage\nand a complete defender set.\n\nWe're happier again  :-)\n\n\n**\nAs all of you people know, in this mud you need to train your skills as\nadjectives, not as percents as some muds have made it.\nIt is widely known that each adjective has 5 steps.\nBut as far as i can remember, there is no thing that would tell you\nwhich step you are working on.\nI am not saying this is compulsory to have or that we cannot live without it,\nbut i think it would make our lives lot more easy.\nThank you. I have spoken.\n\n-------- Proge --------\n\n\n**\nI don't know if i have done something wrong, but...\nI had eq's one day, and I put them into keep.\nThen i got around making exp and finding myself some\nequipments that i do appreciate very high.\nThat's why i got into shop.\nSo, I was in the shop and sold some equipments when I realized that I have sold \nand eq i was having [in keep].\nThis didn't piss me off, but I thought that maybe people who\nhave more valuable items with them and want to\nkeep them with themselves would not like when\ntheir equipments which are not free, as i recall,\nare lost in the shop.\n\nSo, if there is a bug with the 'keep', you could fix it.\ni think that it is one of the most needed commands in MUD.\n\nAll the best,\nPROGE\n\n\n**\n"
