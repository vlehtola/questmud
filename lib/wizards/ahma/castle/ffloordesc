Walking on the first floor of the cavern.
The ground trembles always a bit when you walk onwards, meaning that this
place is on some kind of a platform or that there is open space under the
ground too, meaning another floor. The cavern is a beautiful place, in spite
the fact that it was used for commencing a brutal attack to the peaceful
castle. Walls are covered with enigmatic symbols made up by nature when this
cavern was formed. The red light plays some tricks with two dripstones trying
to reach each other from the ceiling and ground.
