Walking on the second floor of the cavern.
This curving cavern is a rare sight due to its many unique stalactites.
A distant odor of sulphur is floating in the air, which is not unusual
when being near huge amount of stalactites. The reddish steam rising
from the holes on the ground is making your eyes wet. The temperature
is very high, partly due to the hot steam, partly to the hot, red light. 
On the ground, in addon to the holes, can be seen lots of footprints in 
a thin layer of dust, which is falling from the ceiling all the time.
