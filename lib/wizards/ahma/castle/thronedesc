This room is very acoustic due to its huge size and abandoned atmosphere.
The footsteps strongly echo in the room. This huge, empty hall seems to be
lacking its usual pride. The room would be lighted with a thousand torches,
but now there is not a single torch in sight. Six huge stone pillars stand
towards the sky, from the floor to the very ceiling whichis about 30 feet
in height. Lumination in the room is dim, though some light makes its way in
through partly collapsed ceiling and walls. Some huge paintings and carvings
are covering the walls but they are hardly recognizeable due to the lighting
of the hall and the age of the pictures. The throne is located by the northern
wall and one human corpse is lying by the eastern wall, otherwise the room is
abandoned.
