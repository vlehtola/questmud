The fresh courtyard symbolizes the nature inside the castle walls. Main
colour is absolutely green, which can also be seen colouring the plains
and forests of Deleria. A path made of flat, ground stones meanders past
the bushes and trees. Some birds can be heard singing on the branches of
a nearby tree, but rest of the wildlife seems to stay outside the sturdy
castle walls. The fresh air feels fabulous in your lungs after the musty
air inside the castle.

[A smooth, stony fountain is located next to the path.]
fountain ::
A sound made by running water brings the courtyard even more close to
some natural place. A crystal-clear water flows into a bowl carved into
the fountain from a small hole in the tip of a smooth stony pillar.
Thirsty adventurers may satisfy their thirst by drinking from this
beautiful fountain.
