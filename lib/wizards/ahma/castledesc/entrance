The large entrance hall is at least thirty feet high. A wooden chandelier
is hanging high up in the ceiling. The castle walls have been made of rough,
gray stones. On the floor is lying a thin, red carpet. Carpet continues from
here further through the hallways of the castle. Guards' weapon cabinets are
located in an alcove in the eastern wall. Two giant, open doors are located
in the doorway leading out.


chandelier ::
A chandelier has been attached in the ceiling. It seems thoroughly been
made of wood, some joints have been reinforced with iron. There can
faintly be seen few places for candles in the chandelier, but it seems
that it has not been used in a long time. The chandelier must weight
a lot.

walls ::
A rough, gray stones and rocks form the sturdy walls of this castle. The
stones have not been ground nor cut after placing them in their current
places, making the walls look bumpy and somewhat uncomfortable to lean to.

carpet ::
A red and cheap-looking carpet has been laid on the ground. It seems to
cover all the area on the ground where the visitors and owners of the
castle are supposed to walk in. Some stained footprints can be seen
printed on the carpet.

cabinets ::
The wooden cabinets in the entrance room are used by the castle guards
to store their weapons and armour when not being on duty. Though the
cabinets are made of wood, with some steel reinforcements, they are
really sturdy-looking. Every of the cabinets contain an appropriate
lock for their containments.
