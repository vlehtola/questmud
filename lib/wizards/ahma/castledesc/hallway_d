The hallway ends in a narrow staircase leading down. The stones used in the
stairs seem to be ground, unlike the other stones seen in ceiling, ground
and walls. A small window is giving some light into this part of the castle
through the wall. Some torches can also be seen attached on the walls and
giving light in the staircase. A wooden chandelier is hanging down from the
ceiling. The red carpet, which covers most of the hallways and rooms around
the castle, continues down the stairs.


window ::
A small window has been carved in the stony castle wall. Window's shape
is hardly recognizeable. Probably, it has been designed to be circular-
shaped. The light entering the room via window is brightened by the
torches, which are attached to the walls.

chandelier ::
A basic-looking wooden chandelier is hanging from the ceiling. The
chandelier seems to be few iron reinforcements on it, but mostly it
is made of wooden material. Despite all of its candle places, no
candles have been attached to the chandelier.

carpet ::
A red and cheap-looking carpet has been laid on the ground. It seems
to cover all the area along the hallway where the visitors and owners
of the castle are supposed to walk in. Some stained footprints can be
seen printed on the carpet. The carpet leads even down the stairs.
