A small-sized, circular room is sparkling with red particles, rising from
the floor and floating up into the ceiling. Under the floor there must be
something special. The room is low, only about nine feet high. The walls,
ground and ceiling are made of rough, round stones, their colour cannot be
deciphered due to the red lighting of the room. No decoration is seen in
the room, but the red mist and warm atmosphere give the room its respective
being. A wooden sign is located near the doorway leading out of this room.


sign ::
"Healing room, the room of regeneration and rebirth."

particles ::
About the size of a snowflake, these particles rise from the stony floor
of the healing room and rise all the way to the ceiling and even through
it. The particles seem to emit a bright red light and some warmth around
them. The particles are the only decoration this room has to offer.
