The slippery ice makes it hard for you to move around the frozen pond.
There are some spots on the ice which are covered with snow, but mostly
the ice sparkles bald. It also seems that the ice is laying a weak glow
around the area where the pond is. The ice covers the pond thoroughly
and no cracks or such are seen. Some icicles can be seen growing from
the ceiling, which is about thirty feet above the pond's surface. Behind
a small distance in north can be seen some kind of dwellings. In south-
wards can be seen a small path leading up via the snowy hillside.
