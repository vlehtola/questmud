
The thin path is covered with fallen leaves, which make the ground
feel very soft under your feet. The forest is often said to be a
relaxing place, but relaxing in this bellow seems to be almost an
impossible task. Numerous birds are singing on the branches of the
trees lining the path very intensively, and much more voices of
different animals can be heard. There can be heards some noises of
running creatures behind the thick barrier of trees.
