
The forest surrounding the path is so thick, that it almost seems
one cannot move anywhere else but where the path leads. The trees
are sturdy, in spite of the fact that they are mainly deciduous
trees. There are many varieties of trees in here, most sturdiest
of them are the oaks which seem to survive pretty well in this
moist soil. Not much sunlight comes through the thick leaven layer
on the top of the forest.
