
A soft path is leading on towards the darkness of the forest. Some
roots are pushing theirselves up from the ground making the advancing
somewhat harder, or at least more uncomfortable. The big trunks of
deciduous trees are surrounding the path and blocking your way to
anywhere else but where the path is leading. Some leaves can be seen
soothingly fall down from the branches of some unknown trees. The
forest seems somehow make you feel more lively.
