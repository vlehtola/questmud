
Some birds are sitting on the higher branches of the tree. The forest is
a noisy place, but still most of the animals are really precautious about
their surroundings. Trees and bushes around the forest are giving the
smaller animals the needed shelter from bigger, carnivorous animals. The
forest has its own natural cycle with plants and animals involved in it.
It can almost be felt when the animals all around observe your actions.
