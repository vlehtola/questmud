The strange blue light shimmers all around this underground opening.
The exact source of the light cannot be tracked, but the rocks in the
ceiling and ground must be emitting it. The floor and ceiling of the
opening are very smooth. The floor is covered with thin layer of powder-
like small particles of stone. In the northern end of the opening can
be seen some kind of a construction.
