The village square is quite crowded. Salesmen are shouting their
prices and trying to get as many buyers to their crude booths as
possible. Many kinds of creatures move around the square, everyone
and everything with their own purposes: Busy village dwellers trying
to buy their food and other general stuff as cheap as possible,
various animals, wild and tamed, wandering around and begging for
food, Orcish children running around and playing. This really is
what square-life is all about.
