Castle has two separated quests. Q1 is to meet the king, he gives you little task
(kill the orc-chieftain.)
Q2 is to meet the castle alchemist. He is a old friend with the mage of orccamp. You just
have to take that little item what alchemist gives you to that mage. Its simple.. or maybe not.

At the tower is a prisoner who can be killed or saved. To save him, you need to go to orc-chief
and give plans to him(prisoner gives them to you if you choose to save him.)


NOTE:
This is just preliminary plan to this area. I start doing this during next week and
i'll spare as much as i can my freetime to it.
