HEADHUNTER QUEST
==================

30.10.2005 Celtron


GENERAL IDEA 

A monster, called the headhunter or assassin or whatever is stationed at place X.
He is offering quests for players. Quests consist of killing other monsters.
There are two separate quest chains, one for solo killing and the second one
for eq mob killing.

Solo killing quests may require more than one monster of the same type to be killed.

The target monster is randomized by some cool routine amongst all the monsters in the
questmud lib. Then the amount of that monster needed to be killed by the player is
computed. Player receives the short desc of the monster and then has to find it and
finish it off.

When the player returns the head of the killed monster, he gets another quest and
after that another and so on, until he has completed the full amount of quests.


TECHNICAL DETAILS

What needs to be done are the following objets:

 - the quest offering monster. talks to players, and catch_tells the answers. easy.
   gives the pole and completes the quests. each quest is worth 1 qp, the final 
   quests are worth much more. (maybe give a magic item also?)

 - daemon that makes and handles the list of monsters of the questlib. how to do it?
   should the gathering of mob names be done whenever a monster is loaded (from monster.c) ?
   or should the filenames be grepped and then checked for validness?
   /daemons/monster_track_d.c

 - autosave item (a pole) that the player uses to store the head of the killed monster.
   the pole is destructed when the quest is complete. must have chance to re-get the pole
   in case somebody loses his.
