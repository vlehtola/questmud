Another thing is that I should make an city update
Make it more lively, ie roaming mobs

ex. of mobs:
Citizens
Bar Guests
Dogs
Cats
Idea: Dog and cat's could get into a fight with each other once in a while..
         OBS!! Noone of them dies OBS!!
Guards
Patrols, like city guards patroling the area

Directions recivied:
If you kill citymob you get citymob-flag on you and that makes the
guards attack you on sight
The citymob-flag goes away only after you gotten killed by the guards

Check into if you can make it some kind of quest-flag
If it doesn't spam you with that you gotten the quest.. use it
Else I might gonna have to talk with celtron/onarion about
how to add a flag to the player.. (a string I can add into???)
Celtron said something about using a file that I put the names in
shit... I don't know how to do that :)

Check into also all of the desc's..
Maybe some need piffing up
