Balrog
These gigantic creatures usually live in a huge caves
somewhere in the world of Deleria. They have been created
from pure lava and heat. They are superior beings considered
to mere mortals, but some mighty warriors have seen a balrog
once and still have been able to come back and tell people
about them.
