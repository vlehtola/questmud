New base guild: Martial artists (martist) 14.10.2001 //Celtron

STRUCTURE:
  max 40 (50) levels total.
  a starting guild (for ubernewbies also)
  -> cheap skills and detailed first levels

IDEA:
  based on already built and invented skills&skillnames, guilds and systems.

  hand to hand combat.
  -> possibility for advanced fighters to combine fighter guild weapon skills (blades) with "high level" ma-skills.
  NO weaponskills are taught in this guild.

  uses the combat system with some changes in number of hits and damage.
  mortal power obtained by maxxing this guild is supposed to match a level ~50-60 fighter.
  NOTE: this guild is somewhat alike the fighter guild, but unlike the fighter guild martist
        are not supposed to have equal partying options.

  rate slowdowns:
  massage system (to prevent instant max rate for reincing people)
  katas aka series of movement (to prevent damage ability from dropping)
  
  robes are included for each guildmember.
  change: no shadow.


GUILDS:
  10 level baseguild
  3*5 level sideguilds
  5 level adeptguild
  = 40 levels
