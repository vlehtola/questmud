With this skill the Martial artist can call his three elements to help him in combat
and raise his combat abilities. 
This skill puts artist to self-destruction point and he doesn't want to leave from combat
and will fight until the enemy is dead or the artist takes the finishing blow.
When Martial artists call his elements he won't be able to remove them so
artist must wait until the power of ice, fire and thunder leaves from his body.
