Long ago, when the kingdoms of humans were young, great evil rose from
the east. Many battles were fought and finally the kingdoms, with the
help of many great heroes, won the war and destroyed the evil.

For many centuries peace and order has ruled. The humans have prospered
and spread, turned the land in to fields. But the society has decayed
and become corrupted. Military alertness has degenerated in the lack
of threats.

Now however something is happening. Orcs and trolls gather in the mountains,
foul undead creatures have begun to haunt the tombs. Even horrible
demon-like creatures are rumoured to have been sighted. An eternal darkness
is rising from the east.

It must be stopped. If not, everything we know is going to be forgotten for
ever.

The world is again in need of great heroes.
