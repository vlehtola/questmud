This is a small and light forest. Large trees are surrounding the
path in all directions. The trees in here are so large, that they
block the sky with their branches. Birds are singing on the
top of trees and a couple of squirrels are eating nuts on the branches.
A small path leads somewhere which seems to be unknown to you.
