A quite small hut in the center of village. This is made of mud and
hays. Center of hut is a tall log, which seems to support the whole
hut to stand. The hut feels rather moisty and dark, maybe because it
was build on the ground without anykind of floor. A couple of dirty
looking furs are placed on the ground to look something like a bed.
