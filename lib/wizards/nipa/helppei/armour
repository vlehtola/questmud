* There is a generic weapon available. To set up do :
	object ob;
	ob = clone_object("obj/armour");

* For customization the following routines are available.
* You should call these functions in following _order_:


set_class(c)
    int c. Defines the quality of the armour, affects total ac.
    Obligatory. c is between 1 and 9. c = monster_level / 10.
    Whether armour is of leather or metal, c defines the
    quality and toughness.

set_sub_type(str)
    string str. See /doc/build/armour_sub_types for available subtypes.

* Example as follows

inherit "obj/armour";
start() {
  set_class(2);
  set_sub_type("chain mail");
}

* Only to be used in high class equipment from eq monsters:

set_stats(string stat, int bonus)
    Sets positive or negative stat modifiers to item.
    Multiple bonuses are possible.
    stat = "str" | "dex" | "con" | "int" | "wis" | "spr"
    bonus = 1-10

* Note that short and long descriptions are normally automatically
* generated. You should first see the automatically generated descs before
* you set your own, so that you only change it a bit.

set_short(string short)
    Sets a short description for the armour.

set_long(string long)
    Sets a long description for the armour.

set_slot(string slot)
    Sets a slot for the eq, making it a misc eq, that has no ac, but
    can have stats. Note that slot is automatically set if you use
    set_sub_type().
    If you use this, you have to set name, alias, short, long and weight
    for the eq.

set_resists(string resist_type, int percent)
    give the item a protection value against ELEMENTAL damage types.
    resist_type = "fire" | "cold" | "electric"
    percent is between 0 and 40.

In case of problems, ask adepts and archs.
