descit:

enter.c

short: Entrance to the cursed forest
long: In the edge of the forest. There is a forest in the east,
      known to be damned by some evil spirits. You see no trails
      leading in to the forest.


forest1-4.c

short In the damned forest of Moraloth
long  You're standing in the woods or Moraloth, also known as the
      haunted forest. It these said these woods have been damned
      from the beginning of time. There is only faint light coming
      through the branches. It would be easy to get lost in this
      kind of place. The ancient trees seem older than anything
      you've seen before. There is absolutely no voice.


forest5.c

short Deep in the damned forest of Moraloth
long  You've come deeper in to the forest. There is no sky visible
      through the big ancient trees. They seem to get bigger and
      older. Behind the trees and bushes, there seems to be somekind
      path, covered under the thick layer of dead leaves.

path.c

short On a path leading deeper in to the forest.
long  This small path seems to lead you towards the center of the
      forest, if there is any. Somehow there is no sign of any
      footsteps in the ground. There seems to be an opening ahead.
      Maybe it is not a good idea to continue forward.

aukea.c

short Opening in the middle of Moraloth
long  You've come to the middle of the damned forest. There is dried
      blood lying on the grass and weird kind of stones piled in the
      center of the opening. It seems to be an altar to somekind of
      evil ritual. Trees in the edge of the opening seem to have died
      long ago and they are standing leafless and still.


mosat:

short Cursed soul wandering about
long  This is one of the souls of the people who once dwelled within
      these woods. It has been damned to haunt the forest for the
      eternity. It's glowing dark as it floats upon the ground.

short Ghoul of the haunted forest
long  In front of you stands this huge grey and white ghoul. Its a
      nasty looking undead. This is the creature of the dark, raised
      by evil powers within this forest. It is swinging its horrid
      limbs in the air and seems hostile.

short Horrid guardian of the forest
long  This horrible creature before you is dressed in black rags stained
      with blood. Its swinging its huge evil looking sword in the air.
      It makes no noise as it is moving towards you. The air around it
      stinks of death and dread.
