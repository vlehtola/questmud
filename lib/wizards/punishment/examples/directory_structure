For wizards coding areas:

For each are you should have a different directory, like 'area', 'area2',
'forest' or 'cave'. In these dirs you will store the rooms of your
areas. You should have nothing else than these dirs and your  workroom in
your root dir. If you want to make some tests, make a 'test' directory
where you put all the code that is not related to an area.


In each of the area directories mentioned you should have dir 'monsters' 
and 'eq', where are located all the monsters and all the equipment of this
area.
If there are some special objects that don't fit in any of the other dirs,
you could make an 'obj' dir in the area directory to store them.
