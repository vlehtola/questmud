When the world was young, immortal beings roamed the vast plains and lush
forests of our world. They took forms of humans but their divine origin
shone through them and normal humans called them avatars. For a long time,
those avatars were seen in only dreams and visions until some heroic
adventurers drank from the fountain of life. This gave them powers which
compared to the powers of the immortals of ancient times. Thus the people
started calling these heroes Avatars.
