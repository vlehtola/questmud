'Events' are built in game to give players something fun(?) and
different to do. Main idea is to create events that don't need your
character to be experienced. Instead they should require some brain
work or quickness.

Current events:
Get help from an individual event by typing 'help <event>'.

Pkill event

Ps. _New_ ideas are always welcome. That is do not bother us with some
    old ideas from other MUDs. Events should also stick in the
    theme of this world.
