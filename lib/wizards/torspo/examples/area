Some tips on how to make good areas.

1. First of all you should have a good idea of the scenario the area and lots
of ideas of small details. Think of how the area is there and maybe it
would help to invent a whole past for it so the players exploring it
might find some tips on what has happened.
It is a good idea to first draw the area on a paper, before even starting to
code it. That will most likely give a good result.

2. Make the area interesting for example by trying to have some connections
between the thing found in it. Like if your area should be of an 
underground ruined and abandonned city deep beneath the mountains, try
to get it some depth with the long desc. Maybe there should be some strange
marks carved in the stones in four different places that are related to
each other somehow. Maybe it could be the sign of the ancient god the
creatures who lived in there worshipped. If you succeed well, many
questions will rise in the minds of the players. Why was this place
abandonned? Or was it? If not where are the peasants? What is this
strange religion? Why did they build a city down here?
All of these questions should be answerred if the players start exploring
the city. Maybe not directly, but atleast by giving some clues. Succesful
research should also be rewarded. Use the object /obj/explore_.c to reward
with exp.

3. Do NOT write too long descriptions to the rooms if you really have nothing to
tell the players. If the room is important, then write long. Add also
something the players can look at in the long desc.

4. An area should consist atleast one quest. I should be related on the general
scenario. Don't make quests too hard. Rewards for completing quests should
be pretty high.

5. Don't make areas for just bare exp. The area has to have some tension.

6. Think of why the monster is there. It generally has to have a reason for
it. Try to make the monsters as intelligent as possible. They will generally
try to avoid death by all means.

7. A room must always have a light source if it is light. If it is not the
sun, you should include it to the long desc and maybe make it something
you can look at. Light levels are:
   0: complete darkness
   1: dark, but you can see the exits. Items are 'Something lying on the
      floor' and monster are 'Something living in the darkness'.
   2: You can see the short desc of the room. Monsters and items are dark
      shapes, that means you see the short descs but can't look at them.
   3: Normal light level.
Some races can see well in darkness. They always add 1 to the darkness level.  


When you have finished an area, ask a god to approve it so it will be put
in play.
