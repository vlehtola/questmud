This file is dedicated to finding and eliminating errors and bugs.

If there are any errors when loading a new file, the object will not
be loaded at all.

To look at the error message, cat, tail, more or edit the file /log/name, 
where 'name' is your name. Check this file regularly, and trim it if big
(use rm).

Some times when you try to clone a monster, an error message is not
generated. In this case you should try to clone the equipment the monster
has to find out where the bug is. 

If the same happens with a room, test it's monsters and their equipment.

Few tips in order to find the error:

1. Check the line which is returned in error message.
2. Check your logfile for the errors reports.
3. Disable some parts (lines) of your code using /* */ comment marks.
   If the problem persists disable some more.
4. The error may be before the line given. Mostly in this case
   you have forgot to add one or two characters. ie. } or ) 
5. Put debug writes. ie. in case that program returns in middle
   of execution insert 'write("check1\n");' so that you know
   how far the program works. Can be used also if some values
   doesn't seem to compute correctly. ie. in case program returns
   4 instead of 10 insert 'write(variable);' debug messages which
   tell you how the variable changes.
6. In case that you cannot find the error ask help from your fellow
   wizards.
